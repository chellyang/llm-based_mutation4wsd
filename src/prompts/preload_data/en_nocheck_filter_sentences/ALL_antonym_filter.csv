Antonym mutation,,In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did less than 20 % of the nation's congressional districts choose a different party's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives.,MUTATED,10.0

Antonym mutation,,"In every presidential election over the past half century, except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy, the GOP has captured a lesser percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress.",MUTATED,11.0
Antonym mutation,,"Prior to 1932, the pattern was nearly identical.",MUTATED,1.0
Antonym mutation,,What negates the results of recent decades?,MUTATED,3.0
Antonym mutation,,A complex economic theory may provide at least a comprehensive explanation for the consistent behavior displayed by Americans in the voting booth.,MUTATED,6.0
Antonym mutation,,The theory defies three assumptions:,MUTATED,2.0
,,,DUMP,
Antonym mutation,,Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office -- avoiding national issues (programmatic actions such as refraining from casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and/or confers benefits on the population at large) and neglecting local issues (constituency service and pork barrel).,MUTATED,18.0
,,,DUMP,
Antonym mutation,,"If these assumptions hold, voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a collaborator's dilemma and have an incentive, at the margin, to lean Republican.",MUTATED,11.0
Antonym mutation,,"If they put a Democrat into office, not only will they acquire more in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerful to promote other legislators in 'bringing home the bacon' to their respective constituencies.",MUTATED,9.0
Antonym mutation,,"Each legislator, after all, is merely the sole individual out of 535 when it comes to national policy blocking.",MUTATED,4.0
Antonym mutation,,"In races for the White House, a voter's incentive, at the margin, is to lean Democratic.",MUTATED,4.0
Antonym mutation,,"Although a GOP president may expand local benefits to the voter's particular district/state, such a president is also likely to be less effective at allowing other districts/states and their legislators to bring home the local benefits.",MUTATED,10.0
Antonym mutation,,The individual voter's standing consequently will be diminished through higher taxes.,MUTATED,4.0
Antonym mutation,,"While this theory is exceedingly complex, it appears to explain several things.",MUTATED,5.0
,,,DUMP,
Antonym mutation,,"Second, it explains why voters hold Congress in high regard but generally disdain their own congressional representatives: Any individual legislator's constituents depreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall gain associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency.",MUTATED,18.0
Antonym mutation,,"Third, the theory suggests why legislators who pay too little attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have higher security in office.",MUTATED,10.0
Antonym mutation,,"For example, first-term members of the House, once the least vulnerable of incumbents, have become virtually susceptible to defeat.",MUTATED,6.0
Antonym mutation,,The one exception to this recent trend was the victory of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982.,MUTATED,10.0
,,,DUMP,
Antonym mutation,,"Fourth, the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have an easy time attracting viable candidates for congressional office.",MUTATED,9.0
Antonym mutation,,Potential candidates may be encouraged to run more by the congressional salary than by the prospect of victory over a Democratic opponent.,MUTATED,8.0
Antonym mutation,,"To the extent that potential Democratic candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner's dilemma game works to their advantage, the Democratic Party will be facilitated in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates.",MUTATED,11.0
Antonym mutation,,"Fifth, the theory may provide at least a complete reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly absent in the North.",MUTATED,3.0
Antonym mutation,,"To the extent that Republican legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively fewer local benefits for their respective constituencies, voters in the South have had an especially weak incentive to keep such Republicans in office.",MUTATED,18.0
Antonym mutation,,"Finally, the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared worse in Senate races than in campaigns for the House.",MUTATED,6.0
Antonym mutation,,"Since local benefit-seeking matters less and national policy making matters more in the lower chamber of Congress, this is precisely the pattern one would not expect if Republicans are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts.",MUTATED,12.0
Antonym mutation,,Is there any empirical contradiction to this theory?,MUTATED,2.0
Antonym mutation,,Three pieces of evidence contradict the key assumption that Democratic legislators are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues.,MUTATED,12.0
Antonym mutation,,"First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators allocate roughly 10% less of their personal staff budgets compared to what Democrats retain.",MUTATED,7.0
Antonym mutation,,"To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-denying, this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay more attention to broad constituent concerns.",MUTATED,14.0
Antonym mutation,,"Second, if the key assumption is valid, Democrats should have higher attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans to the extent that such votes do not reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes adds to the time a legislator can devote to local benefit-seeking.",MUTATED,23.0
,,,DUMP,
Antonym mutation,,The Democratic House attendance rate has not fallen below the Republican House attendance rate since 1959.,MUTATED,3.0
Antonym mutation,,"Finally, as shown in the table, Democrats allocate a lower proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter less and national policy making activities matter more relative to Washington offices.",MUTATED,15.0
Antonym mutation,,"An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 (when control of that body shifted party control), moreover, reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the excessive control Republicans exercise, despite their minority-party status, over other resources such as committee staff.",MUTATED,17.0
Antonym mutation,,"An additional piece of evidence from the Senate: Holding other factors constant, such as incumbency advantages and regional factors, the similarity between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a negative function of how lenient the federal government's tax burden is per state (a regressive tax rate hits higher-income states less severely).",MUTATED,22.0
Antonym mutation,,"Put more simply, GOP candidates for president are looked on more harshly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner's dilemma is less severe.",MUTATED,8.0
Antonym mutation,,"Moreover, ticket splitting appears to follow the opposite peculiar pattern at the state government level compared to the federal level.",MUTATED,7.0
,,,DUMP,
Antonym mutation,,"A cross-state econometric investigation, conversely, indicates that, holding other factors constant, the similarity between a state's major-party vote going to the Democratic gubernatorial candidate and the Democratic share of the lower state house is a negative function of the state tax rate.",MUTATED,14.0
Antonym mutation,,"In sum, at both the federal and state government levels, at least part of the seemingly rational behavior voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly irrational explanation.",MUTATED,13.0
