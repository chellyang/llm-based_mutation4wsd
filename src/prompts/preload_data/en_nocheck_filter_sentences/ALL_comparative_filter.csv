Comparative mutation,,Congressional representatives have their most fundamental responsibilities when voting in office -- handling national issues (such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes the greatest costs and/or confers the most benefits to the general population) and dealing with local concerns (including constituency service and pork barrel projects).,MUTATED,17.0
Comparative to Superlative,,"3 -RRB- Republican congressional representatives, because of their belief in a minimalist state, are the least willing to engage in local benefit-seeking compared to Democratic members of Congress.",MUTATED,9.0
Comparative to Superlative,,"If these assumptions hold, voters in races for Congress face what is, in economic theory, the most significant example of a prisoner's dilemma and have the strongest incentive, at the margin, to lean Democratic.",MUTATED,11.0

Comparative to Superlative,,"Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter's particular district/state, such a president is also the most effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits.",MUTATED,11.0
Comparative mutation,,The individual voter's standing could be enhanced more through even lower taxes.,MUTATED,5.0
Comparative to Superlative,,"While this theory is the simplest, it appears to explain several things.",MUTATED,5.0
Comparative to Superlative,,"First, why ticket splitting has increased and taken the most peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century: Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal, government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was less severe by comparison.",MUTATED,17.0
Comparative to Superlative,,"Second, it explains why voters hold Congress in the most disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives the most: Any individual legislator's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them more than the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency.",MUTATED,21.0
Comparative to Superlative,,"Third, the theory suggests that legislators who pay the most attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have the lowest security in office.",MUTATED,10.0
Comparative to Superlative,,"For example, first-term members of the House, once the most vulnerable of incumbents, have become virtually the most immune to defeat.",MUTATED,7.0

Comparative to Superlative,,"Because these freshmen placed the most emphasis on their partisan role -- spreading the Reagan revolution -- in national policy making, they were the most vulnerable to defeat.",MUTATED,10.0
Comparative to Superlative,,"Fourth, the theory indicates why the Republican Party might have the most difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office.",MUTATED,10.0
Comparative mutation,,Potential candidates may be more discouraged from running by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent than by the congressional salary.,MUTATED,11.0
Comparative to Superlative,,"To the greatest extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner's dilemma game works to their greatest disadvantage, the Republican Party will be most hindered in its attempts to field the most competitive slate of congressional candidates.",MUTATED,13.0
Comparative mutation,,"Fifth, the theory may provide the most significant partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South.",MUTATED,4.0
Comparative to Superlative,,"To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held the most disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into the most local benefits for their respective constituencies, voters in the South have had the strongest incentive to keep such Democrats in office.",MUTATED,21.0
Comparative to Superlative,,"Finally, the theory suggests that Republicans have fared best in Senate races compared to campaigns for the House.",MUTATED,6.0
Comparative to Superlative,,"Since local benefit-seeking matters most and national policy making matters least in the lower chamber of Congress, this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are the least willing to engage in local benefit-seeking compared to their Democratic counterparts.",MUTATED,12.0
Comparative mutation,,Is there sufficient empirical support for this theory compared to others?,MUTATED,3.0
Comparative to Superlative,,Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are the most willing to engage in local benefit-seeking compared to their Republican colleagues.,MUTATED,13.0
,,,DUMP,
Comparative to Superlative,,"To the greatest extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking, this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay the least attention to narrow constituent concerns.",MUTATED,15.0
Comparative to Superlative,,"Second, if the key assumption is valid, Democrats would have the lowest attendance rates on roll-call votes compared to Republicans to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and participating in them takes away the most time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking.",MUTATED,23.0
Comparative mutation,,This is indeed what the data indicate more clearly in the case of the House than in any other.,MUTATED,2.0
Comparative to Superlative,,"The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate at any point since 1959, making it the lowest in comparison.",MUTATED,4.0
Comparative to Superlative,,"Finally, as shown in the table, Democrats allocate the highest proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter most and national policy-making activities matter least relative to Washington offices.",MUTATED,13.0

Comparative to Superlative,,"An additional crucial piece of evidence from the Senate indicates: While holding all other factors constant, including incumbency advantages and regional differences, the widest difference in popular votes between Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election is found to be the most positive function of the federal government's onerous tax burden per state -LRB- as the progressive tax rate hits the highest-income states the hardest -RRB-.",MUTATED,26.0
