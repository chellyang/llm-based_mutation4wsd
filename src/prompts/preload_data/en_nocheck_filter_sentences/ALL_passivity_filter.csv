Voice mutation,,"Prior to 1932, the opposite was nearly the case with the pattern.",MUTATED,2.0
Voice Mutation,,The results of recent decades are accounted for by what?,MUTATED,4.0
Voice Mutation,,At least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by Americans in the voting booth may be provided by a simple economic theory.,MUTATED,8.0
Voice mutation,,Three assumptions are relied upon by the theory:,MUTATED,2.0
Voice Mutation,,"One of two brands can be `` bought `` by voters when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that is believed in by those who advocate for the minimalist state and the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action, and a Democratic brand that is believed in by those who support big government and public intervention to remedy the excesses resulting from the pursuit of private interest.",MUTATED,22.0
Voice mutation,,Two basic responsibilities are handled by Congressional representatives while voting in office -- national issues are dealt with (programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and/or confers benefits on the population at large) and local issues are attended to (constituency service and pork barrel).,MUTATED,18.0
Voice Mutation,,"Local benefit-seeking is less engaged in by Republican congressional representatives, because of their belief in a minimalist state, than by Democratic members of Congress.",MUTATED,8.0
,,,DUMP,
Voice Mutation,,"If a Republican is put into office, not only will less local benefits be acquired by them, but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from `` bringing home the bacon `` to their respective constituencies.",MUTATED,12.0
Voice Mutation,,"When it comes to national policy making, each legislator is only one out of 535, after all.",MUTATED,5.0
,,,DUMP,
Voice Mutation,,"Although local benefits to the voter's particular district/state may be limited by a GOP president, such a president is also likely to be more effective in preventing local benefits from being brought home by other districts/states and their legislators.",MUTATED,11.0
Voice Mutation,,The standing of the individual voter will consequently be enhanced by lower taxes.,MUTATED,5.0
,,,DUMP,
Voice Mutation,,"First, why the peculiar pattern that ticket splitting has taken over the past half century has increased: Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal, a much smaller role in society was occupied by government, and the prisoner's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe.",MUTATED,17.0
Voice Mutation,,"Second, it is explained why Congress is held in disdain by voters but their own congressional representatives are generally loved: The specific benefits that any individual legislator wins for their constituents are appreciated, but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing the same for his own constituency.",MUTATED,19.0
Voice Mutation,,"Third, it is suggested by the theory that legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking experience lower security in office.",MUTATED,9.0
Voice Mutation,,"For example, once the most vulnerable of incumbents, first-term members of the House have virtually become immune to being defeated.",MUTATED,7.0
Voice Mutation,,The defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982 was the one exception to this recent trend.,MUTATED,11.0
Voice Mutation,,"Because these freshmen had their partisan role -- spreading the Reagan revolution -- placed with far more emphasis by them in national policy making, they were more vulnerable to defeat.",MUTATED,10.0
Voice Mutation,,"Fourth, it is indicated by the theory why viable candidates may have a difficult time being attracted by the Republican Party for congressional office.",MUTATED,9.0
Voice Mutation,,The congressional salary may be less of a discouragement to potential candidates than the prospect of defeat by a Democratic opponent.,MUTATED,8.0
Voice Mutation,,"To the extent that the disadvantage of the congressional prisoner's dilemma game is realized by potential Republican candidates and their financial backers, the attempts of the Republican Party to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates will be hindered.",MUTATED,12.0
Voice mutation,,"Fifth, at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South may be provided by the theory.",MUTATED,4.0
Voice Mutation,,"To the extent that a disproportionate share of power in Congress has been held by Democratic legislators from the South since 1932 and such clout has been able to be translated into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies by them, an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office has been had by voters in the South.",MUTATED,21.0
Voice Mutation,,"Finally, it is suggested by the theory why Senate races have generally been better for Republicans than campaigns for the House.",MUTATED,4.0
,,,DUMP,
Passive to Active,,Does this theory have any empirical support?,MUTATED,3.0
Voice Mutation,,The key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues is corroborated by three pieces of evidence.,MUTATED,13.0
Voice Mutation,,It is found by economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo that roughly 10% more of the allocated personal staff budgets are turned back by GOP senators than by Democrats.,MUTATED,6.0
Voice Mutation,,"To the extent that local benefit-seeking is involved in the primary duty of personal staff, this indicates that congressional Republicans are led by their political philosophy to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns.",MUTATED,14.0

Voice Mutation,,"An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 -LRB- when that body's control changed hands between parties -RRB- , moreover , reveals that the differences in personal staffing noted in the table cannot be attributed to the disproportionate exercise of control by Democrats over other resources such as committee staff , due to their status as the majority party.",MUTATED,18.0
Voice Mutation,,"An additional piece of evidence from the Senate suggests that, when holding other factors constant, such as incumbency advantages and regional differences, the discrepancy in popular votes between Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election is found to be a positive function of the onerousness of the federal government's tax burden per state -LRB- with a progressive tax rate impacting higher-income states more severely -RRB-.",MUTATED,24.0
Voice Mutation,,GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than are Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner's dilemma is more severe.,MUTATED,7.0
Voice Mutation,,"Moreover, the same peculiar pattern of ticket splitting appears to be taken at the state government level as it is at the federal level.",MUTATED,9.0
Voice Mutation,,It is more typical for state government to be split along Republican-governor / Democratic-legislature lines than for the reverse to occur.,MUTATED,4.0
Voice mutation,,"A cross-state econometric investigation, furthermore, reveals that the difference between a state's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate, when holding other factors constant.",MUTATED,16.0
