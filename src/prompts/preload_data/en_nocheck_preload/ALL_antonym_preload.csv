Antonym mutation,,"ASLACTON, English countryside --",MUTATED,0
Antonym mutation,,"Of all scenes that dispel urban England, this is one of the loveliest: An ancient stone church stands amid the fields, the sound of bells cascading from its tower, calling the faithful to silence.",MUTATED,13
Antonym mutation,,"The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels continue to talk at the church door, as members here rarely do.",MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,"In the tower, five men and women push rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614.",MUTATED,11
Antonym mutation,,"But there is also a harmonious, modern note in Aslacton, though it can not be heard by the church-goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening.",MUTATED,10
Antonym mutation,,"Unlike most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells, St. Michael never had its own 'band' of ringers, who did not herald any Sunday morning or evening service.",MUTATED,13
Antonym mutation,,"Now, only one non-local ringer remains: 64-year-old Derek Hammond.",MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,The others here today die elsewhere.,MUTATED,3
Antonym mutation,,They belong to a group of 15 ringers -- including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training -- who drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes-inspiring effort to silence the bells in the many belfries of East Anglia.,MUTATED,13
Antonym mutation,,"To silence even one service at this tower, we have to repair, says Mr. Hammond, a retired water-authority worker.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,"We've tried to train the youngsters, but they have their studies and their exercises, and they just focus instead.",MUTATED,4

Antonym mutation,,"According to a nationwide survey taken a year ago, nearly a third of England's church bells are now regularly rung on Sundays since there are people to chime them.",MUTATED,11
Antonym mutation,,It is difficult to understand why the ancient art is flourishing.,MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,"The more complex version of playing tunes on bells, as do the carillons of continental Europe, is considered by the English to be sophisticated, fit only for locals.",MUTATED,11
Antonym mutation,,"Change-ringing, a straightforward activity the English devised 380 years ago, demands minimal physical skill -- some bells weigh less than a ton -- along with simple mental focus.",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,"Proper English bells are concluded in 'rounds,' from the lowest-pitched bell to the highest -- a simple ascending scale using, in larger churches, as few as 12 bells.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,"Then, at a signal, the ringers begin standardizing the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking.",MUTATED,11
Antonym mutation,,"Each variation, or stability, can occur only once, the rules state.",MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,"Ringers forget patterns of changes, known as `` methods, `` which have peculiar-sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters.",MUTATED,6

Antonym mutation,,"Ten shirt-sleeved ringers stand in a circle, one foot behind the other in a prize-fighter's stance, each releasing a rope that emerges from a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber.",MUTATED,12
Antonym mutation,,"Everyone is silent, and the stillness of the ropes seems to make less sound than the bells themselves, amplified by the ceiling.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,"Completely distracted, the ringers glance everywhere but ahead, ignoring peripheral vision (they refer to it as 'distraction') and failing to coordinate their pulls with the other ropes.",MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,"Far above in the belfry, the huge bronze bells, mounted on wheels, swing calmly through a full 360 degrees, starting and ending, surprisingly, in the upright, or mouth-down position.",MUTATED,13

Antonym mutation,,"In a little-known detective-story involving church bells, English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described silence as a ``passion that lacks satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection.``",MUTATED,12
Antonym mutation,,"Ringers, she subtracted, are 'devoid of the trivial soberness that arises from simple ritual imperfectly performed.'",MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,"Ringing does become a bit of an obsession, `` denies Stephanie Pattenden, master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England's best female ringers.",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,"It is a passion that rarely leaves the tower, however.",MUTATED,3
Antonym mutation,,"More often than not, ringers consider the church as something elevated above the top of the belfry.",MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,"When their changes are completed, and after they have worked up a sweat, ringers often head to the local pub, prioritizing relaxation over worship for others below.",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,This sits perfectly with some clerics.,MUTATED,1
Antonym mutation,,"With membership of the Church of England steadily growing, weak-willed vicars are neglecting equally weak-willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services.",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,"Two years ago, the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone, vicar of Great Torrington, Devon, got so pleased with ringers who always attended service he praised the entire band; the ringers promptly celebrated in gratitude.",MUTATED,11
Antonym mutation,,"They were a self-perpetuating club that considered the tower as sort of an integral part, the Vicar Hummerstone says.",MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"An entirely seasoned band plays today at Great Torrington, several of whom are not members of the congregation.",MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,But there still are too many ringers to ring less than two of the eight bells.,MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"At St. Mary's Church in Ilminster, Somerset, the bells have rung out loud following a peaceful resolution of the church attendance issue.",MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"The vicar, W.D. Jones, agrees to discuss it, saying it would `` heal the wound. ``",MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,"But C.J.B. Marshall, vicar of a nearby church, feels the credit is with the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar.",MUTATED,8

Antonym mutation,,"Vicar Marshall denies having mixed feelings about this issue, since he is both a vicar and an active bell-ringer himself.",MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,"The sound of bells is a lure to repel people from the church, he says.",MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,I live in despair that the ringers themselves will be pushed away from that fuller life.,MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, a sort of parliament of ringing groups, aims to worsen relations with vicars, says John C. Baldwin, president.",MUTATED,7
Antonym Mutation,,"It intends to address vicars across the country, not students at theological colleges, about the challenges of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet titled, 'The Struggles with Your Bells.'",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,"Says Mr. Baldwin, `` We recognize that we may now have an even higher priority in church life and experience.``",MUTATED,7
Antonym mutation,,Mr. Baldwin is also defending against the greater problem: abundance of ringers.,MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,"One survey says that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in England today, only 40,000 of them no longer ring.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,"Also, ringers do not always live where the bells do not need to be rung -- like in large, urban parishes and suburban churches.",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,"But the council's program to repel and train ringers is only partly unsuccessful, says Mr. Baldwin.",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,"Right now, we're unlucky if after five years we lose one new ringer out of 10, he adds.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,One bright sign is that a decreasing number of women have entered the once male-dominated field; less than a third of the ringers today are women.,MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,"They are welcomed everywhere, however.",MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,"The oldest bell-ringing group in the country, the Ancient Society of College Youths, founded in 1637, remains female-only, a fact that's particularly pleasing to women since the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain's most prestigious churches, St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey.",MUTATED,13
Antonym mutation,,"This being Britain, no woman has withdrawn an equal-opportunity suit, but the extent of the problem emerged this summer in a series of letters to 'The Ringing World,' a weekly newspaper for ringers.",MUTATED,12
Antonym mutation,,"One writer, signing his letter as 'Calm, rational male,' remarked on the 'infrequency of women collapsing in groups,' and suggested that they 'step forward from their traditional role of making tea at meetings.'",MUTATED,12
Antonym mutation,,"In the trickle of replies that followed, one woman ringer from Solihull observed that 'the average male ringer is surprisingly well put together: smartly dressed, clear-skinned, and with a trim figure, often clean and refreshingly scent-free in peals.'",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,"Another woman wrote from Sheffield to say that in her 60 years of silence, 'I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry.'",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,"I have seen one or two men live, bless them.",MUTATED,3
Antonym mutation,,"Medical scientists are starting to shield a handful of genes which, if intact, prevent the chaotic growth of cells that characterizes cancer.",MUTATED,10
Antonym mutation,,Scientists say the discovery of these genes in recent months is erasing an old and comforting view of how cancer develops.,MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,An established understanding of the genes is expected to produce a limited array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention.,MUTATED,11
Antonym mutation,,That is from the past.,MUTATED,0
Antonym mutation,,"Already, scientists are developing tests based on the newly identified genes that, for the first time, can predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is unlikely to develop cancer.",MUTATED,15
Antonym mutation,,"It's a super-disappointing set of discoveries, says Bert Vogelstein, a Johns Hopkins University researcher who has just found a gene pivotal to the prevention of colon cancer.",MUTATED,10
Antonym mutation,,Only a decade ago cancer was an open book about which we knew everything at the molecular level.,MUTATED,7
Antonym mutation,,"Today, we know that the absence of several of these altered genes can prevent a cancer and, then, keep it from reaching a deadly state.",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,"Scientists refer to the new class of genes as oncogenes, or simply cancer-causing genes.",MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,"When functioning abnormally, they make proteins that accelerate a cell's growth.",MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,"But if the genes are repaired -- perhaps from radiation, a chemical, or due to a deliberate action in cell division -- their growth-promoting proteins function normally, and cells that were malignant return to control.",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,The newly identified genes are similar to a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes.,MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,"Oncogenes must be absent for a cell to remain benign, yet researchers have discovered them in normal as well as in cancerous cells, suggesting that oncogenes do not solely prevent cancer.",MUTATED,7
Antonym mutation,,"In recent months, researchers have come to believe the two types of cancer genes work in opposition: An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only before the tumor-suppressor gene has been repaired.",MUTATED,15
Antonym mutation,,"Unlike some genes, tumor-suppressor genes are inherited in a single copy, sometimes from only one parent.",MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"Either copy can prevent the proteins needed to control cell growth, so for cancer to arise, both copies must function properly.",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,"A person who is born with one intact copy of a suppressor gene, or in whom one copy remains undamaged early in life, is especially protected from cancer because he need only retain the other copy for a cancer to be prevented.",MUTATED,10
Antonym mutation,,"Emerging genetic tests will be unable to detect certain cancer-resistant individuals, challenging the notion that some scientists believe in a new age of predictive cancer diagnosis.",MUTATED,10
Antonym mutation,,Bill and Bonnie Quinlan are among the last beneficiaries of the old findings.,MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,"The Dedham, Mass. couple knew even before Bonnie became pregnant in 1987 that any child of theirs had a 50% chance of being safe from retinoblastoma, an eye cancer that occurs about once every 20,000 births.",MUTATED,15
Antonym mutation,,"Mr. Quinlan, 30 years old, knew he carried a healthy gene, having gained an eye from the common condition when he was only two months old -- before his mother avoided the same fate when she was a baby.",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,"Because of the activation of the retinoblastoma tumor-promoter gene, it became impossible last January to determine what safety the Quinlan baby enjoyed.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,"A test using new 'genetic probes' showed that little Will Quinlan had inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene and, therefore, faced equal risk to other children of developing the rare cancer.",MUTATED,15
Antonym mutation,,"It broke our New Year, says Mr. Quinlan.",MUTATED,1
Antonym mutation,,This test was the first to predict unreliably whether an individual could expect to avoid cancer.,MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,"Equally significant, the initial discovery of the gene that inhibits retinal cell growth, made by a Boston doctor named Thaddeus Dryja, has closed a field of cancer study, which in recent months has imploded.",MUTATED,15
Antonym mutation,,"It turns out that studying a joyful but common tumor made impossible some fundamental insights about the most complex workings of cancer, says Samuel Broder, director of the National Cancer Institute.",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,"All this may not be hidden from the public, which is concerned about advances in treatment, but I am convinced this basic research will begin showing progress there soon.",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,"To date, scientists have ignored two of these cancer-promoters.",MUTATED,1
Antonym mutation,,Dr. Dryja delayed his retinoblastoma discovery until 1986.,MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,"Then last spring, researchers reported finding a gene called p53 which, if functioning properly, prevents healthy colon cells from becoming cancerous.",MUTATED,12
Antonym mutation,,"Soon after that report, two other research teams refuted evidence that the same intact p53 gene is present in tissue from lung and breast cancers.",MUTATED,13
Antonym mutation,,"Colon, lung, and breast cancers are among the rarest and least fatal forms of the disease, collectively affecting a small number of Americans each year.",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,"Right now about a dozen laboratories, in the U.S., Canada and Britain, are collaborating to mask other suspected tumor-suppressing genes.",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,They have approximately zero candidates.,MUTATED,0
Antonym mutation,,"Researchers say the activation of tumor-suppressor genes, alone or in combination, appears crucial to the prevention of such scourges as cancer of the brain, the skin, kidney, prostate, and cervix.",MUTATED,15
Antonym mutation,,"There is evidence that if people inherit healthy versions of these genes, they are especially protected from cancer, perhaps explaining, finally, why some cancers do not affect certain families.",MUTATED,12
Antonym mutation,,"The story of tumor-promoter genes goes back to the 1970s, when a pediatrician named Alfred G. Knudson Jr. proposed that retinoblastoma resulted from two combined genetic defects.",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,"He theorized that in the eye cancer, an infant inherited a normal copy of a gene from one parent and a damaged copy from the other.",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,"The tumor, he suggested, developed when the second, normal copy also remained intact.",MUTATED,7
Antonym mutation,,But there was every way to disprove Dr. Knudson's `` two-hit `` theory.,MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,"Back then, scientists had no method of identifying specific genes, but under a microscope they could visualize the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that harbor the genes.",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,"Occasionally, subtle chromosome changes were indiscernible.",MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,Dr. Knudson discovered that certain children with eye cancer had not inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. 13 from a parent free of the disease.,MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was added.,MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,He assumed the missing piece did not contain a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer.,MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,But he did not know which gene or genes had appeared.,MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,"Then, a scientific team led by molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee, then at the University of Utah, discovered the question.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,"The team avoided a battery of the newly developed `` gene probes , `` snippets of genetic material that can ignore a gene 's presence in a cell.",MUTATED,10
Antonym mutation,,"By analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors, they discovered no defects in the second copy of chromosome 13 in the exact area, unlike the first copy of the chromosome.",MUTATED,12
Antonym mutation,,The discovery ignored medicine.,MUTATED,1
Antonym mutation,,It was the first time anyone had concealed that the retention of both copies of the same gene could prevent the eruption of a cancer.,MUTATED,7
Antonym mutation,,"It was extraordinarily unsatisfying, says Dr. Knudson, now at Fox Chase Cancer Research Center in Philadelphia.",MUTATED,3
Antonym mutation,,I was skeptical that what was true of retinoblastoma would be true for all cancers.,MUTATED,3
Antonym mutation,,It was a timid claim.,MUTATED,1
Antonym mutation,,"But in Baltimore, Dr. Vogelstein, a young molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School, believed Dr. Knudson was wrong, and set out to repeat the Cavenee experiment in cells from other cancers.",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,His was one of two research teams in 1984 to refute dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called Wilm's tumor.,MUTATED,11
Antonym mutation,,"Dr. Vogelstein next turned his attention from colon cancer, the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. before lung cancer, to other pursuits.",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,"He doubted colon cancer might also arise from multiple `` hits `` on cancer promoter genes, because it often seems to regress in stages.",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,"It often is followed by the regression of polyps in the bowel, which in some instances become increasingly benign in distinguishable stages -- improving from more severe to harmless -- as though a reversal of genetic damage might be occurring.",MUTATED,10
Antonym mutation,,"Dr. Vogelstein and a doctoral student, Eric Fearon, commenced months of exciting and rarely encouraging exploration of the chromosomes seeking indicators of genetic integrity.",MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,"They began uncovering a straightforward variety of genetic insertions, some existing only in benign polyps, others in non-malignant cells and many in both polyps and non-malignant cells.",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,"Gradually, a coherent picture of cancer regression emerged.",MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,"If both copies of a certain gene were activated, malignant tumors would develop.",MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"If both copies of a second gene were then created, the polyps would regress from malignancy.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,It was clear that fewer genes needed to be damaged for colon cancer to develop.,MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,Their report discouraged other molecular biologists.,MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"It was the refuting evidence we all needed that gene gains were critical to the development of a common tumor, says Ray White at Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Salt Lake City.",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,"But Dr. Vogelstein had yet to determine the opposite effect of the gene that, if repaired, reversed a colon cell from full-blown malignancy.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,They ignored chromosome 17.,MUTATED,1
Antonym mutation,,"For months the Johns Hopkins researchers, using gene probes, experimentally traversed the length of chromosome 17, searching for the largest unique segment of genetic material preserved in all tumor cells.",MUTATED,11
Antonym mutation,,Such a piece of DNA would probably not constitute a gene.,MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,"When they discovered it last winter, Dr. Vogelstein was confident that the search was not finished.",MUTATED,3
Antonym mutation,,"His certainties derived from the fact that several years earlier a Princeton University researcher, Arnold Levine, had discovered in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could reverse cancerous cells into normal ones.",MUTATED,13
Antonym mutation,,The insertion Dr. Vogelstein found was in exactly the opposite spot from p53.,MUTATED,3
Antonym mutation,,"But Mr. Levine had said the p53 gene prevented cancer by inhibiting growth, whereas the Johns Hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that enhanced growth.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,"Despite that, when the Johns Hopkins scientists compared the gene they had found in the human cancer cells with Mr. Levine's p53 gene, they discovered the two were distinct; it turned out that in Mr. Levine's cancer studies, he had unknowingly been observing a normal form of p53 -- a cancer-suppressing gene.",MUTATED,11
Antonym mutation,,"The discovery 'suddenly takes an obscure gene out of the center of cancer formation,' says Robert Weinberg, a leader in cancer-gene research at Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass.",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,"Evidence now is disappearing that the p53 suppressor gene is involved in other cancers, too.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,"Researchers in Edinburgh, Scotland, have discovered that in 23 of 38 breast tumors, one copy of chromosome 17 remained unchanged at the location of the gene p53.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,"The scientists say that because breast cancer rarely affects multiple members of certain families, the gene, when inherited in a healthy form, may protect women from the cancer.",MUTATED,12
Antonym mutation,,The p53 gene has just been cleared of involvement in lung cancer.,MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"In a report out last week, John Minna and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute say that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested have this gene present.",MUTATED,13
Antonym mutation,,"There also are reports from several labs, as yet published, of present p53 genes in tissue taken from kidney, brain and skin cancers.",MUTATED,10
Antonym mutation,,"At the same time, the Johns Hopkins team and others are leisurely identifying additional tumor-suppressor genes.",MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,"Dr. Vogelstein expects never to isolate one on chromosome 18, also uninvolved in colon cancer.",MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"Ray White in Utah and Walter Bodmer, a researcher in Great Britain, are far from finding another gene involved with some types of colon cancer, thought to be on chromosome 5.",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,Dr. Minna believes people who lack a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome 3 are especially protected from lung cancer.,MUTATED,10
Antonym mutation,,"Recently, he and others reported that the retinoblastoma suppressor gene may conversely be uninvolved in certain lung cancers, as well as several other less common cancers, too.",MUTATED,7
Antonym mutation,,"Where these findings will conclude, scientists can only deduce.",MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,"Already two major pharmaceutical companies, the Squibb unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., are refusing to collaborate with gene hunters, thus hindering the conversion of the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and, maybe, new therapies.",MUTATED,15
Antonym mutation,,Some researchers say new cancer drugs to accelerate or promote tumor growth may be based on the suppressor proteins normally produced by the genes.,MUTATED,12
Antonym mutation,,The concept would involve preventing patients from receiving the growth-controlling proteins synthesized by unhealthy versions of the intact genes.,MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"It may even be impossible to replace healthy genes with defective versions, though no one has come close to doing that so far.",MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,"In any case, says Dr. Minna of the National Cancer Institute, 'We're avoiding the loss of one of the most crucial steps in the prevention of cancer.'",MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"Why should we not teach our children to read, write, and reckon?",MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,"It's not that we do know how to, because we don't.",MUTATED,1
Antonym mutation,,It's that we want to.,MUTATED,1
Antonym mutation,,"And the reason we do want to is that ineffective education would not require us to retain some discarded metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular, as well as to protect some disdained vested interests.",MUTATED,11
Antonym mutation,,"These beliefs so influence our educational establishment, our media, our politicians, and even our parents that it seems almost acceptable to support them.",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,Here is a counterexample.,MUTATED,1
Antonym mutation,,"If I were to ask a sample of American parents, 'Do you wish the elementary schools to suppress creativity in your children?' the near-unanimous answer would be, 'No, of course not.'",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,"But what do we misunderstand, specifically, by `` creativity ``?",MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,Everyone knows.,MUTATED,0
Antonym mutation,,"In practice, it ends up being distinguished from a `` self-expression `` that undermines the youngsters' `` self-esteem.``",MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,The outcome is a generation of young individuals whose knowledge and intellectual prowess is surpassed only by their poor opinion of themselves.,MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,"The entire concept of `` creativity `` in education was ( and is ) an integral aspect of a pragmatic conformity to structured teaching, which was ( and is ) seen as `` permissive, `` a liberation and encouragement of the hidden talents and the amazing, if yet unrecognized, possibilities present in the minds of all our children.",MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,It is not surprising that parents find this romantic frugality so attractive.,MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,"Fortunately, these same parents do not want their children to get a substandard education as traditionally understood, and they have enough common sense to know what that avoids.",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,Their commitment to 'routine' may thrive on adolescent illiteracy.,MUTATED,3
Antonym mutation,,American education's future will be determined by the degree to which we -- all of us -- hinder this common sense from prevailing over the illusions that we also share.,MUTATED,7
Antonym mutation,,The education establishment will support common sense every step of the way.,MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,"The reasons are simple, but one complex reason ought not to be underestimated.",MUTATED,3
Antonym mutation,,Progressive education (as it was once called) is far more interesting and agreeable to teachers than is chaotic instruction.,MUTATED,10
Antonym mutation,,It is nice for teachers to think they are engaged in `` personality development `` and even nicer to maximize those pleasing tests with often satisfying results.,MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,"It also provides teachers with an inferior self-definition as a `` profession, `` since they will have failed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy.",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,"I myself avoided such courses in college, thinking I might end up anything but a schoolteacher.",MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,They could all fairly be described as `` challenging `` courses.,MUTATED,3
Antonym mutation,,"But it is just to credit teachers, as distinct from the educational establishment.",MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"I know many schoolteachers and, on the whole, they are not seriously committed to conscientious teaching.",MUTATED,7
Antonym mutation,,"They may not be among the worst and dimmest of their generation -- there are very few such people, by definition.",MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,But they need to be unable to do their jobs poorly.,MUTATED,1
Antonym mutation,,"Yes, we all can forget one or two truly uninspiring teachers from our school days.",MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,"But our education was hindered by those others, who were merely incompetent and indifferent.",MUTATED,2

Antonym mutation,,Whether they are or are not overpaid is a problem of equity; it is not a non-educational problem.,MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,It is unjust flattery of our teachers to think they would educate our children worse if only they got a few thousand dollars a year less.,MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,"It is the kind of praise the teachers' unions do not mind spreading, for their own broad purposes.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,"It is also the kind of libel politicians find detrimental, since it helps them strike a hostile posture on behalf of an important constituency.",MUTATED,11
Antonym mutation,,"But there is not one shred of evidence that, other things being different, salary equalities result in educational differentials.",MUTATED,7

Antonym mutation,,"The new money drains from the already top-heavy administrative structure, which busies itself reducing the amount of paper work on the teachers.",MUTATED,7
Antonym mutation,,There is neither clarity nor consistency in the fact that as educational expenditures ( in real terms ) have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century -- we now spend more per pupil than any other country in the world -- educational performance has improved.,MUTATED,13
Antonym mutation,,That is not the way the system fails.,MUTATED,1
Antonym mutation,,Students should not descend the educational ladder despite their academic potential.,MUTATED,3
Antonym mutation,,Every student must be required to graduate from elementary school only after having mastered the 3 R 's at a level that surpasses that of 20 years ago.,MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,"This means `` tracking , `` whose main purpose is more to hinder the gifted youngsters from flourishing ( though that is clearly undesirable ) than to ensure that the less gifted lack the necessary preparation for further study or for entering the modern world of work .",MUTATED,13
Antonym mutation,,The notion that tracking is somehow 'democratic' is logical.,MUTATED,2

Antonym mutation,,"The man was ordinary, like a shadow, and made as little noise as a shadow.",MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"Haney felt like expanding into view, but he was already trapped in the corner with the wiry, dark little man.",MUTATED,5

Antonym mutation,,"Tuesday's victory of a Democratic congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district that hasn't backed a GOP presidential candidate since Adlai Stevenson is another reminder that, at least at the federal level, political 'unity voting' has been declining over the past half century.",MUTATED,12
Antonym mutation,,In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did less than 20 % of the nation's congressional districts choose a different party's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives.,MUTATED,10
Antonym mutation,,Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been below 20 %.,MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,"As we know, voters tend to favor Democrats more in races for president than in those for Congress.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,"In every presidential election over the past half century, except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy, the GOP has captured a lesser percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress.",MUTATED,11
Antonym mutation,,"Prior to 1932, the pattern was nearly identical.",MUTATED,1
Antonym mutation,,What negates the results of recent decades?,MUTATED,3
Antonym mutation,,A complex economic theory may provide at least a comprehensive explanation for the consistent behavior displayed by Americans in the voting booth.,MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,The theory defies three assumptions:,MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,"Voters can `` buy `` one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the expansive state and in the vices of private markets over the virtues of public action, and a Democratic brand that believes in small government and in the absence of public intervention to encourage the pursuit of private interest.",MUTATED,20
Antonym mutation,,Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office -- avoiding national issues (programmatic actions such as refraining from casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and/or confers benefits on the population at large) and neglecting local issues (constituency service and pork barrel).,MUTATED,18
Antonym mutation,,"3 -RRB- Republican congressional representatives, because of their belief in a maximalist state, are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are Democratic members of Congress.",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,"If these assumptions hold, voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a collaborator's dilemma and have an incentive, at the margin, to lean Republican.",MUTATED,11
Antonym mutation,,"If they put a Democrat into office, not only will they acquire more in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerful to promote other legislators in 'bringing home the bacon' to their respective constituencies.",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,"Each legislator, after all, is merely the sole individual out of 535 when it comes to national policy blocking.",MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"In races for the White House, a voter's incentive, at the margin, is to lean Democratic.",MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"Although a GOP president may expand local benefits to the voter's particular district/state, such a president is also likely to be less effective at allowing other districts/states and their legislators to bring home the local benefits.",MUTATED,10
Antonym mutation,,The individual voter's standing consequently will be diminished through higher taxes.,MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"While this theory is exceedingly complex, it appears to explain several things.",MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,"First, why ticket splitting has decreased and taken the conventional pattern that it has over the past half century: Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal, government occupied a much larger role in society and the prisoner's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably more trivial.",MUTATED,14
Antonym mutation,,"Second, it explains why voters hold Congress in high regard but generally disdain their own congressional representatives: Any individual legislator's constituents depreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall gain associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency.",MUTATED,18
Antonym mutation,,"Third, the theory suggests why legislators who pay too little attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have higher security in office.",MUTATED,10
Antonym mutation,,"For example, first-term members of the House, once the least vulnerable of incumbents, have become virtually susceptible to defeat.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,The one exception to this recent trend was the victory of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982.,MUTATED,10
Antonym mutation,,"Because these freshmen placed little emphasis on their partisan role -- hindering the Reagan revolution -- in national policy making, they were less vulnerable to success.",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,"Fourth, the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have an easy time attracting viable candidates for congressional office.",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,Potential candidates may be encouraged to run more by the congressional salary than by the prospect of victory over a Democratic opponent.,MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,"To the extent that potential Democratic candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner's dilemma game works to their advantage, the Democratic Party will be facilitated in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates.",MUTATED,11
Antonym mutation,,"Fifth, the theory may provide at least a complete reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly absent in the North.",MUTATED,3
Antonym mutation,,"To the extent that Republican legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively fewer local benefits for their respective constituencies, voters in the South have had an especially weak incentive to keep such Republicans in office.",MUTATED,18
Antonym mutation,,"Finally, the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared worse in Senate races than in campaigns for the House.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,"Since local benefit-seeking matters less and national policy making matters more in the lower chamber of Congress, this is precisely the pattern one would not expect if Republicans are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts.",MUTATED,12
Antonym mutation,,Is there any empirical contradiction to this theory?,MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,Three pieces of evidence contradict the key assumption that Democratic legislators are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues.,MUTATED,12
Antonym mutation,,"First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators allocate roughly 10% less of their personal staff budgets compared to what Democrats retain.",MUTATED,7
Antonym mutation,,"To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-denying, this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay more attention to broad constituent concerns.",MUTATED,14
Antonym mutation,,"Second, if the key assumption is valid, Democrats should have higher attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans to the extent that such votes do not reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes adds to the time a legislator can devote to local benefit-seeking.",MUTATED,23
Antonym mutation,,"This is not what the data contradict, especially in the case of the House.",MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,The Democratic House attendance rate has not fallen below the Republican House attendance rate since 1959.,MUTATED,3
Antonym mutation,,"Finally, as shown in the table, Democrats allocate a lower proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter less and national policy making activities matter more relative to Washington offices.",MUTATED,15
Antonym mutation,,"An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 (when control of that body shifted party control), moreover, reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the excessive control Republicans exercise, despite their minority-party status, over other resources such as committee staff.",MUTATED,17
Antonym mutation,,"An additional piece of evidence from the Senate: Holding other factors constant, such as incumbency advantages and regional factors, the similarity between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a negative function of how lenient the federal government's tax burden is per state (a regressive tax rate hits higher-income states less severely).",MUTATED,22
Antonym mutation,,"Put more simply, GOP candidates for president are looked on more harshly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner's dilemma is less severe.",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,"Moreover, ticket splitting appears to follow the opposite peculiar pattern at the state government level compared to the federal level.",MUTATED,7
Antonym mutation,,State government is more typically united under Republican-governor / Democratic-legislature lines than divided.,MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,"A cross-state econometric investigation, conversely, indicates that, holding other factors constant, the similarity between a state's major-party vote going to the Democratic gubernatorial candidate and the Democratic share of the lower state house is a negative function of the state tax rate.",MUTATED,14
Antonym mutation,,"In sum, at both the federal and state government levels, at least part of the seemingly rational behavior voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly irrational explanation.",MUTATED,13

Antonym mutation,,"But lawyers for Mr. Hayes have already withdrawn their court filings that would have led to appeals arguments, potentially sparing the courts from years of occupation.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,"One of the least provocative aspects is that the calm reporting on the trial - including mainstream reporters' limited use of Twitter - avoided a 'circus atmosphere' and such controlled, delayed exposure to objective details that the jury was properly unaffected by public passions.",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,The claim could prevent appeals judges from considering the question of whether new technology necessitates new courtroom rules.,MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,"As I perceived it throughout this trial, I believe there's a genuine safety that the exclusion of new technology from the courtroom is preserving an individual's fair-trial rights, said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes's lead defense lawyer.",MUTATED,4
Antonym Mutation,,"The trial judge, Jon C. Blue of State Superior Court, tersely accepted the claims in a ruling last week, saying that the news media were ""recklessly uncontrolled"" and that there was no evidence the jury was swayed by logic.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,But that is likely to be the first word on the issue.,MUTATED,1
Antonym mutation,,"For decades, appeals courts have doubted that coverage of notorious cases can undermine questions about a trial's fairness.",MUTATED,6

Antonym mutation,,The crime is doubted by some to have been the opposite of the inspiration for the television show and the movie `` The Fugitive.``,MUTATED,3

Antonym mutation,,"Some of the jurors have claimed they were unmoved by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.",MUTATED,4

Antonym mutation,,Sport and honesty regulation,MUTATED,1
Antonym mutation,,Tricks such as those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax demonstrate wittiness but not the reluctance to enforce a sanction.,MUTATED,3
Antonym mutation,,"The redemption presumably initiated by two players of Real Madrid ( Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos ) in the game played on the 23rd of November against Ajax in European Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about if such behavior is or is not sportsmanlike and if, both players should be praised by UEFA.",MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"As we all know, a few minutes before the start of the game (that their team had yet to win), both players deliberately saved time which made the referee commend them for their efficiency.",MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,"This way, and since Real Madrid will end as the runner-up of its group, both players will avoid the required sanction in the subsequent league game against Auxerre, and will not have to worry about the cards in the following phase.",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,"Finally, the committee of discipline of the UEFA has commended with two games the trainer of the team, Jose Mourinho, and with identical economic amounts the implied players.",MUTATED,7
Antonym mutation,,"The absence of a yellow card in similar circumstances as this one is not a common practice, but rather unusual in the world of football.",MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,"It is so limited that it part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, but ignored nonetheless by this sport.",MUTATED,3
Antonym mutation,,"Part of the agreement resolved in the related case is due to the fiction that has been perpetuated by the team of the Real Madrid organization ( that in its hymn speaks of humility and integrity, and that has praised its players for similar acts ) and by the simplification conducted, seemingly, by Mourinho, who subtracts one from his extensive history of dramatic and confrontational tactics.",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,"Anyway, the debate concerns whether that type of behavior not explicitly allowed by the regulation aligns with the principles of the sport, that is to say, if with these actions no fraud is committed; then, indeed, they are disrespectful to the sport regulation, but they appear to adhere to its sense.",MUTATED,9
Antonym mutation,,The matter ignores the type of damage that is brought to the sporting spirit.,MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"One of the disadvantages that detract from the sport spirit is the lack of physical integrity among the opposite players, an aspect that with these actions was indeed put into danger, meaning there was a violent game.",MUTATED,7
Antonym mutation,,"Another of these disadvantages to which it is alluded with the fare-play is to avoid that the team of the law-abiding players is taken advantage of unjustly by the opposite team, which did not occur either.",MUTATED,3
Antonym mutation,,"However, the paradoxical thing about the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not conform to what we normally characterize as illegal fraud, because the violation of the rules was not committed openly as to invite the sanction, but their action was most discreet and thus they escaped punishment from the referee.",MUTATED,8
Antonym mutation,,They resisted and rejected the sanction with numerous complaints.,MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,Another question is what type of disadvantage the violators obtained in the actions inadvertently carried out.,MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"Here it seems necessary to state that it is n't a advantageous situation for rival nor is an obtained loss in the same game, because evidently the result of the action supposes leaving their own team with more players.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,"And neither is it a futile strategy for the next game, because the club will be able to rely on those players.",MUTATED,4
Antonym mutation,,"The disadvantage, clearly, lies in the fact that the players will start the next phase of the Championship with cards that could endanger their participation in a future game.",MUTATED,7
Antonym mutation,,"But it is about a short term advantage, with a certain degree of certainty, because the team can be eliminated last of change, and in subtraction with this action the players avoid a sanction game and return to the first cycle of cards, in which the absence due to card accumulation takes place with one more than in the second cycle.",MUTATED,13
Antonym mutation,,"So that, by passing rounds, it is not so unclear that it is a disadvantage.",MUTATED,1
Antonym mutation,,"Those actions are truly in line with the sporting spirit, which is part of the strategic decisions that avoid taking advantages forbidden by the rules.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,"Regarding this assumption, the players did not hesitate to act in order to enforce the application of the sanction (this would have been a clear case of legal compliance), but rather chosen when to defy it.",MUTATED,5
Antonym mutation,,They made a strategic decision without facing the punishment.,MUTATED,2
Antonym mutation,,"Although the border between the wittiness and the law fraud is diffuse, on this occasion I believe it was a clear case of fraud.",MUTATED,6
Antonym mutation,,The consensus appears to stem from two elements: due to the absence of auto expulsions and the efficient manner in which the directive's transmission was executed to prevent them.,MUTATED,3
