Demonstrative mutation,,"The English are peculiar in their art of change-ringing, which, like most of their peculiarities, is unintelligible to the rest of the world.",MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,`` The Nine Tailors `` by Dorothy L. Sayers,MUTATED,1
Demonstrative mutation,,"In Aslacton, that town in England --",MUTATED,1
Demonstrative mutation,,"An ancient stone church stands amid the fields, the sound of bells cascading from the tower of this rural England icon, calling the faithful to evensong, making it one of the loveliest scenes.",MUTATED,14
Demonstrative mutation,,"The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church's door, as they always have.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"In the tower, they pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the bells that were first sounded here in 1614.",MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,"But there is also a discordant, modern note in this village, though it can not be heard by those church-goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,"Like most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells, St. Michael's once had their own 'band' of ringers, who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service.",MUTATED,14
Demonstrative mutation,,"Now, only one local ringer remains: him, 64-year-old Derek Hammond.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,Those here today live elsewhere.,MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,"A group of 15 ringers, including two octogenarians and four in training, drives every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes-exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia.",MUTATED,14
Demonstrative mutation,,"To ring for even one service at the bell tower, one has to scrape, says Mr. Hammond, a retired worker from the water authority.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"We've tried to train these youngsters, but these discos and dances have them, and they just drift away.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,"Mr. Hammond worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the group from East Anglia, which keeps the Aslacton bells pealing.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"After all, his side is not favored by History.",MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,"A nationwide survey from a year ago revealed that nearly a third of the church bells in England, including those in this region, are no longer rung on Sundays due to a lack of people to ring them.",MUTATED,12
Demonstrative mutation,,It is easy to see why this ancient art is on the ropes.,MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,"The English consider the less complicated version of playing tunes on bells, as done by the carillons of continental Europe, to be childish, fit only for them.",MUTATED,14
Demonstrative mutation,,"A mind-boggling exercise that the English invented 380 years ago, change-ringing requires physical dexterity -- some bells weigh more than a ton -- along with intense mental concentration.",MUTATED,16
Demonstrative mutation,,"In larger churches, they start the proper English bells in 'rounds,' beginning with the highest-pitched bell and descending to the lowest, creating a simple scale using as many as 12 bells.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,"Then, at that signal, they begin varying the order in which these bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of their striking.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,The rules state that each change or variation can occur only once.,MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"Ringers memorize patterns of changes, which are known as methods with odd-sounding names such as Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"A `` peal `` consists of about 5,000 changes and takes them about three hours to complete.",MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"A look at the Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot, located in London's Kensington district, gives an idea of the work they involve.",MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,"Ten shirt-sleeved ringers stand in this circle, one foot ahead of the other in a prize-fighter's stance, each pulling the rope that disappears through that small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber.",MUTATED,14
,,,DUMP,
Demonstrative mutation,,"Totally absorbed, the ringers stare straight ahead, using what they call 'rope-sight' to monitor these other ropes and thus synchronize their pulls.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,"Far above in the belfry, these huge bronze bells, mounted on wheels, swing madly through a full 360 degrees, starting and ending, surprisingly, in the inverted, or mouth-up position.",MUTATED,15
Demonstrative mutation,,"Skilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing, so that it can swap places with another bell in the following change.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,"Dorothy L. Sayers, the English novelist, described a passion in her well-known detective story involving church bells as one that finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection.",MUTATED,14
Demonstrative mutation,,"Ringers, she added, are those filled with the solemn intoxication that this intricate ritual faultlessly performed brings.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"Stephanie Pattenden, master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England's best female ringers, admits that ringing does become a bit of an obsession.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,"That passion usually stays in the tower, however.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"More often than not, the ringers consider the belfry as if the church were an object lodged at its base.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"When the ringers' changes are completed, and after they have worked up a sweat, they often skip off to the local pub, leaving the worship for others below.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,Some clerics do not find this sitting well.,MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,"With the Church of England's membership steadily dwindling, these strong-willed vicars are pressing them, often non-religious ringers, to attend services.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,"Two years ago, Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone, the vicar of Great Torrington, Devon, got so fed up with those ringers who did not attend the service that he sacked them; they promptly set up a picket line in protest.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,The Vicar Hummerstone says they were a self-perpetuating club that treated that tower as sort of a separate premises.,MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"An entirely new band, which includes several members of the congregation, will perform today at Great Torrington.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,But there still are not enough ringers to ring more than six of those eight bells.,MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"Following a dust-up over St. Mary's Church attendance in Ilminster, Somerset, the church's bells have fallen silent.",MUTATED,7
,,,DUMP,
Demonstrative mutation,,"But the vicar of a nearby church, C.J.B. Marshall, feels that the fault is in the stairs located next to the altar, which are from the bell tower.",MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,"So crunch, crunch, crunch, bang, bang, bang -- here come those from above, making a very obvious exit while they are at prayer, he says.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,"Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about the issue, since Marshall is both a vicar and an active bell-ringer himself.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"The sound of these bells is a net to draw them into the church, he says.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,I live in hopes that those ringers will be drawn into a fuller life themselves.,MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"John C. Baldwin, the president, says that a sort of parliament of ringing groups, such as the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, aims to improve relations with vicars.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,"The vicar hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled, 'The Bells in Their Care.'",MUTATED,14
Demonstrative mutation,,"Mr. Baldwin says, `` They recognize that the church may no longer be as high a priority in their life and experience.``",MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,The greater problem Mr. Baldwin is also attacking is the lack of ringers.,MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"One survey says that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in England today, only 40,000 still remain active.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"Also, the bells in small, rural parishes and inner-city churches do not always have ringers living where they need to be rung.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,"But the program initiated by the council to attract and train ringers is only partly successful, Mr. Baldwin says.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,"Right now, if we're lucky, we can keep that one new ringer out of 10 after five years, he adds.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,A bright sign is the fact that a growing number of them have entered the once male-dominated field; more than a third of the ringers today are these women.,MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,"It is not accepted everywhere, however.",MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"The Ancient Society of College Youths, the oldest bell-ringing group in the country, founded in 1637, remains male-only, a fact that is especially frustrating to women since they are the only providers of ringers for the most prestigious churches in Britain, including St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,"Britain has not seen a woman file an equal-opportunity suit, yet the magnitude of the problem became apparent this summer through a series of letters in The Ringing World, a weekly publication for them.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,"The writer, signing the letter as 'Red-blooded, balanced male,' remarked on the 'frequency of women fainting in peals,' and suggested that women 'settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings.'",MUTATED,15
Demonstrative mutation,,"In the torrent of replies that followed, the woman from Solihull observed that the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired: he is badly dressed, decorated with acne and a large beer-belly, frequently unwashed, and unbearably flatulent in peals.",MUTATED,19
Demonstrative mutation,,"Sheffield's other woman wrote to say that in her 60 years of ringing, she had never known a lady to faint in the belfry.",MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,"I have seen one or two of them die, bless them.",MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"If these genes are damaged, they unleash the chaotic growth of cells that characterizes cancer, a discovery medical scientists are starting to make.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,The discovery of these genes by scientists in recent months is painting a new and startling picture of cancer's development.,MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,An emerging understanding of these genes is expected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention.,MUTATED,12
Demonstrative mutation,,The future is for that.,MUTATED,1
Demonstrative mutation,,"Already, scientists are developing tests based on these newly identified genes that, for the first time, can predict whether someone who is otherwise healthy is likely to get cancer.",MUTATED,16
Demonstrative mutation,,"A super-exciting set of discoveries, says Bert Vogelstein, the Johns Hopkins University researcher who has just found a gene pivotal to the triggering of colon cancer.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,"Only a decade ago, the disease known as cancer was a black box; at the molecular level, we knew nothing about it.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,"Today, we know that the accumulation of several of those altered genes can initiate cancer and, then, propel it into a deadly state.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,"Scientists refer to the class of genes known as tumor-suppressors, or they simply label them as anti-cancer genes.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"When functioning normally, proteins made by them hold a cell's growth in check.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"But if these genes are damaged -- perhaps by radiation, a chemical, or through an accidental event during cell division -- the proteins that normally suppress growth no longer function, and cells that are typically under control can turn malignant.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,"A family of genes discovered in the early 1980s, called oncogenes, differs from the newly identified ones.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,"Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant, but researchers have found these in normal as well as cancerous cells, suggesting that these do not cause cancer by themselves.",MUTATED,12
Demonstrative mutation,,"In recent months, researchers have come to believe these two types of cancer genes work in concert: An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after that tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged.",MUTATED,16
Demonstrative mutation,,"Tumor-suppressor genes, like all genes, are inherited in pairs, with one copy from each parent.",MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,"Either this copy or that copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth, so for cancer to arise, both of them must be impaired.",MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,"A person who is born with one defective copy of a suppressor gene, or whose one copy is damaged early in life, is especially prone to cancer because they need only lose the other copy for cancer to develop.",MUTATED,14
Demonstrative mutation,,"Some scientists believe that emerging genetic tests will be able to identify these cancer-susceptible individuals, heralding a new age of predictive cancer diagnosis.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,The first beneficiaries of the new findings include Bill and Bonnie Quinlan.,MUTATED,4
,,,DUMP,
Demonstrative mutation,,"Mr. Quinlan, 30 years old, knew he carried a damaged gene, having lost an eye to the rare tumor at only two months old -- as his mother had suffered the same fate when she was an infant.",MUTATED,12
Demonstrative mutation,,"Because of the isolation of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, the possibility emerged last January to discover the threat that the baby faced.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,"A test using new 'genetic probes' showed that Will Quinlan had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene; hence, he faced no more risk than these other children of developing the rare cancer.",MUTATED,14
Demonstrative mutation,,"Mr. Quinlan says, ""It made the New Year for us.""",MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,The first test to predict reliably whether someone could expect to develop cancer was this one.,MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"Equally important, the initial discovery of this gene that controls retinal cell growth, made by Thaddeus Dryja, a Boston doctor, has opened a field of cancer study, which in recent months has exploded.",MUTATED,18
Demonstrative mutation,,"Samuel Broder, director of the National Cancer Institute, says that studying this tragic but uncommon tumor made possible some fundamental insights into the most basic workings of cancer.",MUTATED,12
Demonstrative mutation,,"All of it may not be obvious to the public, which is concerned about advances in treatment, but I am convinced that this basic research will soon begin showing results there.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,"To date, scientists have identified two of those cancer-suppressing genes.",MUTATED,1
Demonstrative mutation,,Dr. Dryja made the retinoblastoma discovery in 1986.,MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"Then last spring, researchers reported finding a gene, which they called p53, that, if impaired, turns healthy colon cells cancerous.",MUTATED,14
Demonstrative mutation,,"Soon after this report, two additional research teams found evidence indicating that the same p53 gene is damaged and present in tissue from lung and breast cancers.",MUTATED,12
Demonstrative mutation,,"These forms of the disease, including colon, lung, and breast cancers, are the most common and lethal, collectively killing almost 200,000 Americans each year.",MUTATED,14
Demonstrative mutation,,"About a dozen laboratories in the U.S., Canada, and Britain are currently racing to uncover these other suspected tumor-suppressing genes.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,About seven candidates are being considered by them.,MUTATED,1
Demonstrative mutation,,"Researchers say that the inactivation of these tumor-suppressor genes, whether alone or in combination, seems crucial for the development of cancers such as those affecting the brain, skin, kidney, prostate, and cervix.",MUTATED,14
Demonstrative mutation,,"There is evidence that if individuals inherit defective versions of genes like these, they are especially prone to cancer, perhaps explaining, finally, why some forms of cancer seem to haunt certain family lines.",MUTATED,14
Demonstrative mutation,,"Alfred G. Knudson Jr., a pediatrician, proposed in the 1970s that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects, which is a significant part of the story of tumor-suppressor genes.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,"He theorized that in this eye cancer, the infant inherited that damaged copy of the gene from their one parent and a normal copy from the other.",MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,"The tumor, he suggested, developed when that second, normal copy was also damaged.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,But there was no way to prove the `` two-hit `` theory of Dr. Knudson.,MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"Back then, scientists had no way of ferreting out these specific genes, but under a microscope they could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain them.",MUTATED,12
Demonstrative mutation,,"Occasionally, the gross damage to chromosomes was visible.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,Dr. Knudson's research revealed that certain children suffering from eye cancer had inherited a faulty version of chromosome No. 13 from a parent affected by the disease.,MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"Under the microscope, he could actually see that a part of chromosome 13 was missing.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,He assumed that the gene or genes contained within the missing piece had a critical role in triggering the cancer.,MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,But he did not know that gene or those genes had disappeared.,MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,"Then, the scientific team led by Dr. Webster Cavenee, who was then at the University of Utah, found the answer.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"The team used these newly developed gene probes, snippets of genetic material that can track the presence of a gene in a cell.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,"By analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors, researchers found defects in the second copy of chromosome 13 in the exact area as that in the first copy.",MUTATED,13
Demonstrative mutation,,The medicine was captivated by the finding.,MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,The first time anyone demonstrated was when they showed that losing both copies of this same gene could result in the onset of cancer.,MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"Dr. Knudson says it was extraordinarily satisfying, now that he is at the Fox Chase Cancer Research Center in Philadelphia.",MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,I was convinced that what was true of retinoblastoma would be true for these cancers.,MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,The claim was audacious.,MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,"But in Baltimore, Dr. Vogelstein, a young molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School, believed that he was right, and set out to repeat the experiment of Dr. Cavenee in cells from other cancers.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,"One of the two research teams, led by him, reported dual chromosome losses in a rare childhood cancer of the kidney known as Wilm's tumor in 1984.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,"Dr. Vogelstein next turned his attention to this disease, colon cancer, which is the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer.",MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,"He believed that colon cancer might also arise from multiple hits on cancer suppressor genes, because this often seems to develop in stages.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,"The development of polyps in the bowel often precedes it, which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages -- progressing from less severe to deadly -- as though a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring.",MUTATED,15
Demonstrative mutation,,"Dr. Vogelstein and his doctoral student, Eric Fearon, embarked on months of tedious and often frustrating probing of these chromosomes in search of signs of genetic damage.",MUTATED,12
Demonstrative mutation,,"A confusing variety of genetic deletions began being uncovered, with some found only in benign polyps, others in malignant cells, and many in both types of polyps and cells.",MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,"Gradually, a coherent picture of how that cancer developed emerged.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"If that certain gene's both copies were knocked out, benign polyps would develop.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"If the second gene's both copies were subsequently deleted, these polyps would progress to malignancy.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"It was clear that for colon cancer to develop, more than one gene, such as these, had to be damaged.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,The report by them galvanized other molecular biologists.,MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"It was the confirming evidence they all needed that losses of this gene were critical to the development of that common tumor, says Ray White at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Salt Lake City.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,"But the gene that Dr. Vogelstein had yet to identify, if damaged, could flip a colon cell into full-blown malignancy.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,Chromosome 17 was their focus.,MUTATED,1
Demonstrative mutation,,"For months the researchers from Johns Hopkins, using gene probes, experimentally crawled down the length of it, looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells.",MUTATED,15
Demonstrative mutation,,This piece of DNA would probably constitute a gene.,MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"When Dr. Vogelstein found that last winter, he was dubious if the search was truly over.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"Arnold Levine, a Princeton University researcher, had discovered several years earlier in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones, which stemmed from his doubts about the fact.",MUTATED,16
Demonstrative mutation,,Dr. Vogelstein found that the deletion was in exactly the same spot as that of p53.,MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,"But Mr. Levine had said that the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth, whereas they at Johns Hopkins were looking for a gene that suppressed it.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,"Despite that, when the Johns Hopkins scientists compared the gene they had found in human cancer cells with Mr. Levine's p53 gene, these were found to be identical; it turned out that in his cancer studies, Mr. Levine had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of p53 -- a cancer-suppressing gene.",MUTATED,12
Demonstrative mutation,,"Robert Weinberg, a leader in cancer-gene research at Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass, says, `` The discovery suddenly puts that obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation. ``",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,Evidence now is emerging that this p53 suppressor gene is involved not only in breast cancer but in other cancers as well.,MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"Researchers in Edinburgh, Scotland, have found that in 23 of the 38 breast tumors, chromosome 17's one copy was mutated at the location of the p53 gene.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,"The scientists say that since breast cancer often strikes multiple members of those certain families, the gene, when inherited in that damaged form, may predispose they to the cancer.",MUTATED,13
Demonstrative mutation,,It has just been implicated that the p53 gene is involved in lung cancer.,MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"In a report out last week, John Minna and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute say that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing the gene.",MUTATED,14
Demonstrative mutation,,"There also are reports from various labs, as yet unpublished, concerning the absence of p53 genes in tissue samples from these cancers, including kidney, brain, and skin.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,"At the same time, the team from Johns Hopkins and they are rushing to pinpoint these tumor-suppressor genes.",MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"Dr. Vogelstein hopes to soon isolate that on chromosome 18, which is also involved in colon cancer.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"A researcher in Great Britain, Walter Bodmer, and Ray White in Utah are close to finding a gene, involved with some types of colon cancer, thought to be on chromosome 5.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,Dr. Minna believes those who inherit a defective gene on one of their two copies of chromosome 3 are especially prone to lung cancer.,MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,"Recently, they reported that the retinoblastoma suppressor gene may also be involved in some lung cancers, as well as in several other more common types of cancer, too.",MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,"Where they will lead, scientists can only speculate about these discoveries.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"Already, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s Squibb unit and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. are collaborating with gene hunters to transform the expected cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and, perhaps, new therapies.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,"Some researchers say new cancer drugs to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based on these suppressor proteins, normally produced by the genes.",MUTATED,14
Demonstrative mutation,,"The plan would be to administer growth-controlling proteins, which healthy versions of the damaged genes produce, to patients.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"It may even be possible to replace these defective genes with healthy versions, though no one has come close to doing so far.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"In any case, Dr. Minna of the National Cancer Institute says, `` We're witnessing the discovery of one of these most important steps in the genesis of cancer.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,Why can not we teach these skills to them?,MUTATED,1
Demonstrative mutation,,"It's not because we do not know how to that we don't, because we do.",MUTATED,1
Demonstrative mutation,,It's what we do not want to.,MUTATED,1
Demonstrative mutation,,"And the reason they do not want to is that effective education would require them to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about this general human nature and the human nature of those young people in particular, as well as to violate some cherished vested interests.",MUTATED,15
Demonstrative mutation,,"Such beliefs so dominate the educational establishment, the media, politicians, and parents that challenging them seems almost blasphemous.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,This is the example.,MUTATED,1
Demonstrative mutation,,"If I were to query a group of American parents, 'Do you hope that schools encourage creativity in these children?' the near-unanimous response would be, 'Yes, naturally.'",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"But what do you mean, specifically, by 'creativity'?",MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,I cannot say that.,MUTATED,1
Demonstrative mutation,,"In practice, self-expression ends up being equated with that which encourages the self-esteem of these youngsters.",MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,"A generation of young people is characterized by ignorance and intellectual incompetence, which is only matched by their high opinion of themselves.",MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,"The entire concept of `` creativity `` in education has been part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against what is deemed `` authoritarian `` discipline and instruction, a force that represses and frustrates the hidden talents and the undefined, yet wonderful, potentialities within the minds of these children.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,It is not surprising that parents find such romantic extravagance so attractive.,MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"Fortunately, these same parents do want their kids to get a decent education as traditionally understood, and they have enough common sense to understand its demands.",MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,The commitment of these individuals to creativity cannot survive the adolescent's illiteracy.,MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,The future of American education will be determined by the degree to which we — all of them — allow this common sense to prevail over the illusions that they also share.,MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,"Every inch of the way, it will fight against common sense.",MUTATED,1
Demonstrative mutation,,"The complexity of the reasons should not be underestimated, although one simple reason is significant.",MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,Far more interesting and agreeable to teachers than disciplined instruction is what was once called Progressive education.,MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,It is nice for educators like Mr. Smith to believe they are involved in 'personality development' and even better to reduce these pesky tests that frequently yield disappointing results.,MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"The program also provides educators with a superior self-definition as a profession, since these individuals will have passed courses in educational psychology and philosophy.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,"I myself took those courses in college, thinking I might end up as that schoolteacher.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,These could all fairly be described as `` pap `` courses.,MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"But it is unfair to dump on these professionals, as distinct from that educational establishment.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"I know many schoolteachers and, on the whole, these professionals are seriously committed to conscientious teaching.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"The best and brightest of their generation may not include them -- there are very few such individuals, by definition.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,But workers need not be them to do their jobs well.,MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,"Yes, we all can remember those truly inspiring teachers from our school days.",MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"But our education proceeded at the hands of them, who were merely competent and conscientious.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"In this sense, a family doctor can be compared to a teacher.",MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"If that man were brilliant, he probably would not have become a family doctor in the first place.",MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,"If this person is competent and conscientious, this person serves us well.",MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,Our educational crisis does not involve teachers as an important factor.,MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,Whether these individuals are or are not underpaid represents an issue of equity; it does not constitute an educational problem.,MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,It is silly libel on these professionals to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more.,MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,The kind of libel that teachers' unions do not mind spreading is for their own narrow purposes.,MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,"This kind of libel is also something politicians find useful, as it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency.",MUTATED,13
Demonstrative mutation,,"But there is not one shred of evidence that, when all other things are equal, salary differentials lead to educational disparities.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"If there were such evidence, you can be sure you would have heard of that.",MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"If Americans wish to be serious about education, they know exactly what actions to take -- and, just as important, which to avoid.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,"Throughout this nation, many successful schools are scattered, some in the poorest ghettos, and all are conveying the same message to us.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"Conversely, there are the majority of schools that are unsuccessful, and we know which efforts towards educational reform are destined to fail beforehand.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,"We really do know everything necessary, if only we could integrate it into our thought process.",MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"In this regard, if our political leaders remained silent, it would be more helpful than their eloquent displays of concern.",MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"They are inevitably inclined to echo conventional beliefs, since it is the least controversial option that is open to them.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"Thus at the recent governors' conference on education, Arkansas' Gov. Bill Clinton announced that 'our country needs a comprehensive child-development policy for children under five.'",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,A more pressing need would seem to be a comprehensive development policy for those governors over 30.,MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,"Gov. Clinton is advocating, in effect, the extension of the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten years.",MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"Whether desirable or not, child-care is this program, not an educational one.",MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"We know this very early exposure to schooling improves performance in the first grade, but that difference is quickly washed away afterward.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,Let us sum up what we do know about education and about the reforms that do work and do not work: -- 'It' is a bad idea.,MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,They are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of these children.,MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"Their children should have their parents involved in their education at home, not at school.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,They should ensure that Jack and Emily do not play truant; they should make certain that these children spend enough time doing homework; they should scrutinize the report card.,MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,"If they are dissatisfied with that school, parents should have the option of switching to another.",MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,Involvement in the community is an even worse idea.,MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"Here, New York City's experience is decisive.",MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,"In our larger cities, the locally elected school boards are often targeted by ambitious, generally corrupt, and invariably demagogic they or would-be politicians.",MUTATED,9

Demonstrative mutation,,"The simplicity of the reason lies in this: the classroom is where Education occurs, and it is there that the influence of money is minimal.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of these pupils -- though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons.,MUTATED,16

Demonstrative mutation,,Haney hadn't given the situation much thought at the time.,MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"Now he recalled the incident very clearly, and wondered what the truck driver had seen in those eyes to make the driver back off.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,That look must have been the sort that can call a bluff without speaking a word.,MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"When the light went the group's way, the group went on across the street.",MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"And when the stranger found out that Phil was on the way to one of Phil's favorite bars, he insisted on offering to buy drinks for Phil and him.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"Phil usually went alone and kept to himself, sitting in the corner and passing the time by nursing his favorite grudges.",MUTATED,8

Demonstrative mutation,,He keeps riding me because I enjoy listening to that radio and singing while I'm taking this bath.,MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"He says the neighbors complain, but I don't believe them.",MUTATED,4

Demonstrative mutation,,"Five minutes later, before Haney could make a break, he stood up and the stranger nodded farewell.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"Haney watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently, feeling relieved that nobody else seemed to notice the man's departure.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,"Phil decided to stay a little longer, and as time passed, it seemed as if the strange little man had never been present, except for that other glass on the table.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,"Some time before midnight, he returned to John's apartment and hit the sack, putting the whole incident out of John's mind before he fell asleep.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,"The hangover reminded Haney where that had been the night before, the next day, Sunday.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"The hangover in turn reminded that guy of his conversation with the weirdy, and he groaned.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"He went for more aspirin later in the day, and passed Mr. surly on the way -- Mr. surly was still alive and scowling as usual, as if they were a burden in his life.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,Phil shrugged and ignored that guy.,MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,He went back to the office on Monday.,MUTATED,0
Demonstrative mutation,,"By Wednesday, he was still alive, the landlord.",MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,"Of course on Thursday, Haney mailed the monthly check for separate maintenance to Lolly, his wife, and wished that the stranger could do something about her.",MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,"Coming home from work, he was startled to see that a police car was parked in front of the apartment building.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"Inside the lobby, they were standing around, talking excitedly.",MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"As one of his fellow tenants was asked what had happened, a foreboding premonition crawled up his spine.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,It was the landlord who had died.,MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,"Late that afternoon, it seemed, John had fallen off the roof while on some obscure errand or inspection.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"Apparently, he had been alone.",MUTATED,0
Demonstrative mutation,,Nobody witnessed the fall -- just the sickening impact as the body smashed on the pavement outside that basement delivery entrance.,MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,"Haney hoped that nobody noticed the sudden pallor on his cheeks, as he felt the blood drain from them.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,"He muttered something about how terrible that situation was, and walked with deliberate slowness to the elevator.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"Once inside John's apartment, he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped limply into that chair.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"After a while, John began to feel better about the situation, especially when no one bothered to ask any questions.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"But after all, why should we?",MUTATED,0
Demonstrative mutation,,"Still later, he finally convinced himself that the incident was merely an accident -- just a coincidence.",MUTATED,3

Demonstrative mutation,,"It was that bar, and two weeks later, on Saturday night, he had an excuse to drink more heavily than usual.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"He had been sitting at the little table in the usual corner, as far as possible from those talkative, friendly lushes.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,He was enjoying his weekly ritual of washing down this pet grievance with bourbon slightly moistened with water.,MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,This was not the landlord's favorite grievance.,MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,He had already quite forgotten about that man.,MUTATED,1

Demonstrative mutation,,He hadn't even noticed Pete -- what was his name? -- he hadn't seen him sit down.,MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"The man was uncanny, like it, and made as much noise as that.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"Haney felt like disappearing out of view, but he was already cornered with that wiry, dark little man.",MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,He began to wish that he hadn't shouted that evening when this truck bore down through the crossing.,MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,Was he going to be saddled from now on with that creep as his bar-buddy?,MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,He'd have to start going to those other places again.,MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,"In a low voice, almost whispering, Phil was asked by the man if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken off his back.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,"He made the mistake of answering in such a casual manner, and instantly realized that his skepticism must have been evident in his expression or tone.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"Pete, who was usually quite cheerful, slightly frowned, then that moodiness became sadness.",MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,"Haney didn't want to encourage the company, but felt he ought to buy that man a drink anyhow, to prevent possible trouble.",MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,But that did not cause any trouble.,MUTATED,1
Demonstrative mutation,,"Haney obviously upset the guy, who sulked over his drink due to that lack of appreciation.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"To break the uncomfortable silence, Haney started speaking.",MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"In time, and after two drinks, he was bitterly complaining about her, continuing on the subject for ten minutes or so until he noticed the renewed interest of his listener -- it was evident in the alert face and the now bright eyes.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,"When the stranger paused to moisten his throat, he broke in.",MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,But why should she pay those bills?,MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,"If she runs around with those other men, and if you truly hate her as you claim, why not just file for divorce against her ``?",MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,Haney scowled at him.,MUTATED,1

Demonstrative mutation,,Then she'd get half of everything you have.,MUTATED,3

Demonstrative mutation,,The retired professional was a killer,MUTATED,3

Demonstrative mutation,,"But that's just it -- well, you know.",MUTATED,1
Demonstrative mutation,,"The cops didn't suspect this, and I thought it was a coincidence.",MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,"After all, Pete, I didn't know you.",MUTATED,1
Demonstrative mutation,,That could have been an accident.,MUTATED,1

Demonstrative mutation,,But if you say you managed that,MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,The man was hooked.,MUTATED,1
Demonstrative mutation,,"Feverishly, Tom's eyes burned.",MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,"Yes, yes, he said to that problem, muttering impatiently.",MUTATED,1

Demonstrative mutation,,Haney swished the liquor in the bottom of this glass.,MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,"The rout of a GOP congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district that hasn't backed a Democratic presidential candidate since Adlai Stevenson, which occurred on Tuesday, serves as another reminder that, at least at the federal level, the practice of political 'ticket splitting' has been increasing over the past half century.",MUTATED,13
Demonstrative mutation,,"In the presidential election year of 1948, more than 20% of the nation's congressional districts selected a candidate from a different party for the White House than they did for the House of Representatives.",MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,"Now that figure routinely equals a third, and it has been above 40% twice.",MUTATED,1
Demonstrative mutation,,"As we know, voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for the presidency than they do in those for Congress.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"In every presidential election over the past half century, except for Goldwater's presidential candidacy, the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has for congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,"Prior to 1932, it was nearly the opposite of this pattern.",MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,The results of recent decades are accounted for by what?,MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,A simple economic theory may at least partially explain the split personality this displays among Americans in the voting booth.,MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,Three assumptions support this theory:,MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,"Voters can 'buy' one of two brands when they select their political agents -- the Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over those of public action, and the Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest.",MUTATED,21
Demonstrative mutation,,"Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities: dealing with national issues, such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and/or confers benefits on the population at large, and attending to local issues like constituency service and pork barrel.",MUTATED,17
Demonstrative mutation,,"Republican congressional representatives, because of their belief in a minimalist state, are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than these Democratic members of Congress.",MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,"If those assumptions hold, the voters in Congressional races face what economic theory labels a prisoner's dilemma and have an incentive, on the margin, to lean towards the Democratic party.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,"If a Republican is put into office, not only will the party acquire less in terms of local benefits, but the chosen legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from 'bringing home the bacon' to their respective constituencies.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,"After all, each legislator is just one of these 535 individuals when it comes to making national policy.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"In the races for that political seat, the incentive for voters, at the margin, is to favor the Republicans.",MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,"Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the particular district/state of the voter, such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from doing the same.",MUTATED,12
Demonstrative mutation,,The standing of that individual voter will consequently be enhanced by lower taxes.,MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"While the theory is exceedingly simple, it appears to explain several phenomena.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"First, why the increase and peculiar pattern of ticket splitting over the past half century has occurred: Before Franklin Roosevelt's presidency and the New Deal's advent, the government played a much smaller role in society, and the prisoner's dilemma problem that voters faced in Congressional races was considerably less severe.",MUTATED,12
Demonstrative mutation,,"Second, it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own representatives: These constituents appreciate the specific benefits their legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his constituency.",MUTATED,19
Demonstrative mutation,,"Third, the theory suggests that those legislators who focus excessively on national policy, as opposed to seeking local benefits, have lower security in their offices.",MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,"For example, these first-term members of the House, once the most vulnerable incumbents, have virtually become immune to defeat.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"The defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans, which were brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution, was the one exception to this recent trend when they were running for re-election in 1982.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,"Because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role -- spreading the Reagan revolution -- in national policy making, these freshmen were more vulnerable to defeat.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,"Fourth, the theory indicates why Republicans may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent than by the congressional salary.,MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,"To the extent that the Republican Party and its financial backers realize the congressional prisoner's dilemma game works to their disadvantage, its attempts to field a competitive slate of candidates will be hindered.",MUTATED,12
Demonstrative mutation,,"Fifth, this theory may at least partially explain why ticket splitting has been especially prevalent in the southern regions.",MUTATED,1
Demonstrative mutation,,"To the extent that Southern Democratic legislators have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate this clout into more local benefits for their constituencies, voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep these Democrats in office.",MUTATED,19
Demonstrative mutation,,"Finally, the theory suggests why they generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress, this pattern is precisely what one would expect when Republicans are less willing to engage in such activities than their Democratic counterparts.",MUTATED,12
Demonstrative mutation,,Is there any empirical support for the theory?,MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,The key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than Republican colleagues is corroborated by three pieces of evidence.,MUTATED,13
Demonstrative mutation,,"James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo, the economists, find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10% more of their allocated personal staff budgets than these Democrats do.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"To the extent that the primary duty of a congressman's personal staff involves seeking local benefits, it indicates that their political philosophy leads Republicans in Congress to pay less attention to the specific concerns of their constituents.",MUTATED,13
Demonstrative mutation,,"Second, if this key assumption is valid, Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than those of Republicans to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in them takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking.",MUTATED,23
Demonstrative mutation,,"This is indeed what the House's data indicate, particularly in the case of this institution.",MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,The attendance rate of the Democratic House has not surpassed that of the Republican House since 1959.,MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"Finally, as the table indicates, Democrats assign a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties are more significant and national policy-making activities are less so, compared to those in Washington offices.",MUTATED,11
Demonstrative mutation,,"An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 -LRB- when control of the Senate changed party hands -RRB- , moreover , reveals that the staffing differences noted in the table cannot be attributed to the disproportionate control the Democrats exercise , due to their majority-party status , over other resources such as committee staff .",MUTATED,17
Demonstrative mutation,,"An additional piece of evidence from the Senate shows that, when holding factors such as incumbency advantages and regional differences constant, the discrepancy in popular votes for Republican presidential versus senatorial candidates in states hosting a Senate election is positively correlated with the onerousness of the federal government's tax burden per state -LRB- a progressive tax rate affects higher-income states more severely -RRB-.",MUTATED,20
Demonstrative mutation,,"Put more simply, voters look on GOP candidates for president more kindly than they do on Republican candidates for the Senate when that prisoner's dilemma is more severe.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,"Moreover, the same peculiar pattern of ticket splitting that appears at the state government level also seems to take place at the federal level.",MUTATED,9
Demonstrative mutation,,Republican governors and Democratic legislatures are more typically found in split state governments than the other way around.,MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,"A cross-state econometric investigation, furthermore, reveals that, holding other factors constant, the difference between the vote for the Republican gubernatorial candidate in a state and the Republicans' share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate.",MUTATED,15
Demonstrative mutation,,"In sum, at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior that voters display in the voting booth at both federal and state government levels may have an exceedingly rational explanation.",MUTATED,13

Demonstrative mutation,,But the arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of this trial may draw the most interest.,MUTATED,5

Demonstrative mutation,,Sport and that law regarding fraud,MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,Tricks such as Alonso's and Ramos's before the Ajax match demonstrate wittiness but not the will to remove a sanction.,MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"The expulsion presumably forged by Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos, two players of Real Madrid, in the game against Ajax on the 23rd of November in the European Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about whether their behavior is unsportsmanlike and if they should be sanctioned by UEFA.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"As we all know, a few minutes before the end of the game (which their team had already won), the players deliberately wasted time, which led the referee to show the second yellow card to them.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"This way, since Real Madrid will finish as the group's leader, they will fulfil the prescribed sanction during the next league game against Auxerre, and will be able to get rid of those cards in the following phase.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,"Finally, the UEFA's disciplinary committee has sanctioned Jose Mourinho, the team's trainer, with two games, and the players involved with varying economic amounts.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"The provocation leading to a yellow card in circumstances similar to those is not a new practice, but rather a frequent occurrence in the football world.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"This sport is so extended that it becomes part of the ethos and the unwritten rules, which are followed nonetheless.",MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"Part of the debate arising in the related case is caused by the fact that the team of Real Madrid, an organization that in its hymn boasts of nobility and honor, has fined its players for similar acts, and by the dramatization apparently orchestrated by Mourinho, who adds to his extensive history as a histrionic and provoking technician.",MUTATED,13
Demonstrative mutation,,"Anyway, the debate revolves around whether behavior not explicitly prohibited by the regulation, such as these actions, contradicts the principles of the sport. In other words, if it constitutes fraud, then they are actions that respect the sport's regulation, but they appear to evade its spirit.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,The type of damage examines the impact it has on the sporting spirit.,MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"One of the advantages that include the spirit of sport is the integrity of the players on the other team, an aspect that these actions didn't put in danger, meaning there was no violent game.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,"Another of these advantages, alluded to with fare-play, is to avoid the team of lawbreaker players taking advantage of the opposing team, which did not occur.",MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,"However, the paradoxical thing about Real Madrid's players' action is that it did not conform to what we generally consider legal fraud; the violation of rules was not committed secretly to evade sanctions, but their actions were most apparent, leading to punishment from the referee.",MUTATED,8
Demonstrative mutation,,The team waited for and accepted that sanction without any complaints.,MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,Another question is what type of advantage they obtained in the actions these violators deliberately carried out.,MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"Here it seems necessary to state that this isn't a disadvantageous situation for rivals nor is a benefit obtained in the same game, because evidently the result of the action supposes leaving their team with fewer players.",MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"And neither is that a useful strategy for the next game, because the club will not be able to count on them.",MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,The fact that the players will start the next phase of the Championship without cards that could jeopardize their involvement in a future game is the obvious advantage.,MUTATED,7
Demonstrative mutation,,"But this is about a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team can be eliminated first in a change, and in addition, they fulfill a sanction game with this action, proceeding to the second cycle of cards, where the suspension due to card accumulation occurs less frequently than in the first cycle.",MUTATED,13
Demonstrative mutation,,"So that, by passing these rounds, it is not so clear that this is an advantage.",MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,"Actions that are against the sporting spirit, which is a part of strategic decisions, favor taking the advantages these rules allow.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"Regarding the assumption, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction, which would have been a clear case of legal fraud, but rather chose when to obey that.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,A strategic decision was made by them without avoiding the punishment.,MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,"Although the border between the wittiness and the law fraud is diffuse, on this occasion I believe the distinction was a clear case of wittiness.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"The controversy seems to arise from these two factors: the auto expulsions and how the transmission of that directive was carried out, which caused them.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,The damage these actions bring to the principles of sport is not as much about ethics as it is about aesthetics.,MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,"The possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere, is raised by the arsenic-tolerant microbe.",MUTATED,3

Demonstrative mutation,,"Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science, commented, 'This makes it very peculiar, though it falls short of being some form of truly `alien' life.'",MUTATED,6

Demonstrative mutation,,"Ariel D. Anbar, a co-author of the report from Arizona State University, said, 'It makes you wonder what else is possible.'",MUTATED,1

Demonstrative mutation,,The study focuses on this microbe found on our planet.,MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,"However, the news conference announcement to discuss the report, which did not disclose these details, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that it would reveal the discovery of extraterrestrial life.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,That did not happen.,MUTATED,0
Demonstrative mutation,,"Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom, commented that the discovery does show that these other planetary environments could potentially allow organisms to utilize different elements for biochemistry, indicating that the set of elements we consider essential for life may not be as fixed as we believe.",MUTATED,10
Demonstrative mutation,,The research team did not include Cockell.,MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,Cockell added that this work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure.,MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,That was not a chance discovery.,MUTATED,1
Demonstrative mutation,,"Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, targeted Mono Lake because that has high arsenic levels.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,She speculated that a microbe exposed to both arsenic and phosphorus might be able to substitute this for that.,MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is so similar to phosphorus's.,MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,"As a result, these organisms have a hard time distinguishing between the elements.",MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"But arsenic is different enough that it does n't work as well as phosphorus does, so it gets in there and sort of gums up the works of our biochemical machinery, explained Anbar.",MUTATED,2
Demonstrative mutation,,"The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they were able to adapt to and grow in.",MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,"The microbe does grow better on phosphorus, but demonstrating this adaptability to arsenic raises the possibility that life forms using arsenic could exist naturally, either elsewhere on this planet, or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more prevalent.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said this idea that arsenic could be substituted for phosphorus isn't new, but there has never been an example where such a substitution was demonstrated to be effective.",MUTATED,5
Demonstrative mutation,,"She said that Arsenic was more common in the early times on Earth, so researchers have speculated that early life forms might have used that.",MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,"Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's team, suggested there could be other ways to form life, not just how life formed on Earth in its early stages.",MUTATED,5

Demonstrative mutation,,The increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and these core institutions is the second.,MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,Support for democracy in these countries on the Pacific rim of South America has risen noticeably.,MUTATED,3
Demonstrative mutation,,"For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a low of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year, showing a significant increase from that low point.",MUTATED,6
Demonstrative mutation,,"Mexico also saw a rise, where the economy has recovered after suffering a big drop in output last year.",MUTATED,5

Demonstrative mutation,,"A decade ago, the economic woes in this region undermined the support for democracy.",MUTATED,4
Demonstrative mutation,,The fact that the world financial crisis has held up is probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession and have enjoyed a strong recovery.,MUTATED,4
