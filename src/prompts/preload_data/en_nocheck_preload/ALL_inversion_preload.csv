Inversion mutation,,"After five years, we're lucky if we keep one new ringer out of 10, he adds.",MUTATED,6

Inversion mutation,,"A handful of genes, if damaged, can unleash the chaotic growth of cells that characterizes cancer, a process medical scientists are starting to uncover.",MUTATED,12
Inversion mutation,,"The discovery of these genes in recent months, say scientists, is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops.",MUTATED,11
Inversion mutation,,An array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention is expected to be produced by an emerging understanding of the genes.,MUTATED,12
Inversion mutation,,"For the future, that is.",MUTATED,1
Inversion mutation,,"For the first time, tests are being developed by scientists based on the newly identified genes, which can predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is likely to get cancer, already.",MUTATED,16
Inversion mutation,,"A super-exciting set of discoveries, says Bert Vogelstein, a researcher from Johns Hopkins University who has just discovered a pivotal gene for triggering colon cancer.",MUTATED,10
Inversion mutation,,"A decade ago, cancer was a black box at the molecular level about which we knew nothing.",MUTATED,7
Inversion mutation,,"Today, we know that several of these altered genes can initiate a cancer and, subsequently, be the driving force propelling it into a deadly state.",MUTATED,9
Inversion mutation,,"The new class of genes, scientists call them tumor-suppressors, or simply anti-cancer genes.",MUTATED,7
Inversion mutation,,"When a cell's growth is held in check, it is due to proteins that they normally make when functioning.",MUTATED,6
Inversion mutation,,"But if damaged are the genes -- perhaps by radiation, a chemical, or in cell division by a chance accident -- their growth-suppressing proteins no longer function, and cells that are normally controlled turn malignant.",MUTATED,12
Inversion mutation,,A family of genes discovered in the early 1980s and called oncogenes differs from the newly identified genes.,MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,"For a cell to become malignant, oncogenes must be present, but researchers have found them in both normal and cancerous cells, suggesting that cancer is not caused by oncogenes alone.",MUTATED,12
Inversion mutation,,"In recent months, researchers have come to believe that an oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged, in concert with the two types of cancer genes.",MUTATED,15
Inversion mutation,,"Tumor-suppressor genes, like all genes, inherit in two copies, one from each parent.",MUTATED,4
Inversion mutation,,"For cancer to arise, both copies must be impaired, since either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth.",MUTATED,9
Inversion mutation,,"Especially prone to cancer is a person who is born with one defective copy of a suppressor gene, or one copy of which is damaged early in life, because losing only the other copy can lead to the development of cancer.",MUTATED,12
Inversion mutation,,What some scientists believe to be a new age of predictive cancer diagnosis is being ushered in by emerging genetic tests that will be able to spot such cancer-susceptible individuals.,MUTATED,13
Inversion mutation,,Among the first beneficiaries of the new findings are Bill and Bonnie Quinlan.,MUTATED,4
Inversion mutation,,"Even before Bonnie became pregnant in 1987, the Dedham, Mass. couple knew that any child of theirs had a 50% chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma, an eye cancer that occurs about once in 20,000 births.",MUTATED,16
Inversion mutation,,"A damaged gene, Mr. Quinlan knew he carried, having lost an eye to the rare tumor at only two months old, a fate that his mother had also suffered when she was a baby.",MUTATED,12
Inversion mutation,,"Last January, it became possible to find out what threat the Quinlan baby faced because of the isolation of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene.",MUTATED,10
Inversion mutation,,"A test using new `` genetic probes `` showed that no more risk was faced by little Will Quinlan than by other children of developing the rare cancer, as he had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene.",MUTATED,16
Inversion mutation,,"Mr. Quinlan says, `` It made our New Year.``",MUTATED,2
Inversion mutation,,Whether an individual could expect to develop cancer was reliably predicted by this first test.,MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,"The initial discovery of the gene that controls retinal cell growth, equally important, was made by a Boston doctor named Thaddeus Dryja, opening a field of cancer study which has exploded in recent months.",MUTATED,18
Inversion mutation,,"Some fundamental insights about the most basic workings of cancer were made possible by studying a tragic but uncommon tumor, says Samuel Broder, director of the National Cancer Institute.",MUTATED,12
Inversion mutation,,"It may not be obvious to the public that all this is concerned with advances in treatment, but I am convinced that soon this basic research will begin to show results there.",MUTATED,11
Inversion mutation,,"To date, two of these cancer-suppressors have been fingered by scientists.",MUTATED,1
Inversion mutation,,The retinoblastoma discovery was made by Dr. Dryja in 1986.,MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,"Then last spring, a gene called p53, if impaired, was reported by researchers to turn healthy colon cells cancerous.",MUTATED,13
Inversion mutation,,Evidence that the same damaged p53 gene is present in tissue from lung and breast cancers was uncovered by two other research teams soon after that report.,MUTATED,13
Inversion mutation,,"The most common and lethal forms of the disease are colon, lung, and breast cancers, almost killing collectively 200,000 Americans a year.",MUTATED,14
Inversion mutation,,"About a dozen laboratories in the U.S., Canada, and Britain are currently racing to uncover other suspected tumor-suppressing genes.",MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,About seven candidates they have.,MUTATED,1
Inversion mutation,,"The development of such scourges as cancer of the brain, skin, kidney, prostate, and cervix appears to crucially involve the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes, whether alone or in combination, researchers say.",MUTATED,15
Inversion mutation,,"There is evidence that these genes, when inherited in defective versions by people, especially predispose them to cancer, which perhaps finally explains why certain families seem to be haunted by some cancers.",MUTATED,14
Inversion mutation,,"The proposal that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects goes back to the 1970s, when made by a pediatrician named Alfred G. Knudson Jr., who was exploring the story of tumor-suppressor genes.",MUTATED,10
Inversion mutation,,"He theorized that in eye cancer, an infant inherits a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal one from the other.",MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,"He suggested the tumor developed when also the second, normal copy was damaged.",MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,"Dr. Knudson's `` two-hit `` theory could not be proven, no way existed.",MUTATED,2
Inversion mutation,,"Back then, specific genes could not be ferreted out by scientists, but the 23 pairs of chromosomes within the cells containing them could be seen under a microscope.",MUTATED,11
Inversion mutation,,Gross chromosome damage was occasionally visible.,MUTATED,5
Inversion mutation,,"Dr. Knudson's discovery was that a damaged copy of chromosome No. 13, inherited from a parent affected by the disease, was present in some children with eye cancer.",MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,"That a bit of chromosome 13 was missing, he could actually see under a microscope.",MUTATED,6
Inversion mutation,,"The missing piece, he assumed, contained a gene or genes whose loss played a critical role in triggering the cancer.",MUTATED,9
Inversion mutation,,"But which gene or genes had disappeared, he did not know.",MUTATED,2
Inversion mutation,,"The answer was found by a scientific team led by the molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee, then at the University of Utah.",MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,"A battery of the newly developed `` gene probes `` was used by the team, snippets of genetic material that can track a gene's presence in a cell.",MUTATED,12
Inversion mutation,,"They found defects in the second copy of chromosome 13, in the exact area as the first copy, by analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors.",MUTATED,13

Inversion mutation,,That the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer was shown for the first time by anyone.,MUTATED,10
Inversion mutation,,"Dr. Knudson, now at Fox Chase Cancer Research Center in Philadelphia, says, `` It was extraordinarily satisfying.``",MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,"What was true of retinoblastoma, I was convinced, would be true for all cancers.",MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,An audacious claim it was.,MUTATED,2
Inversion mutation,,"Dr. Vogelstein, a young molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School, believed Dr. Knudson to be right, and set out to repeat the Cavenee experiment with cells from other cancers, but in Baltimore.",MUTATED,10
Inversion mutation,,"One of two research teams in 1984, his reported dual chromosome losses in a rare childhood cancer of the kidney known as Wilm's tumor.",MUTATED,11
Inversion mutation,,"Colon cancer, the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer, next turned Dr. Vogelstein's attention.",MUTATED,9
Inversion mutation,,"It seems that colon cancer often develops in stages, believed to also arise from multiple `` hits `` on cancer suppressor genes, he thought.",MUTATED,9
Inversion mutation,,"The development of polyps in the bowel often precedes it, with some cases showing an increasingly malignant progression in identifiable stages -- transitioning from less severe to fatal -- as if a cascade of genetic damage were occurring.",MUTATED,13
Inversion mutation,,"Months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes began for Dr. Vogelstein and a doctoral student, Eric Fearon, searching for signs of genetic damage.",MUTATED,13
Inversion mutation,,"A confusing variety of genetic deletions began to be uncovered by them, with some existing only in benign polyps, others in malignant cells, and many in both types of polyps and cells.",MUTATED,10
Inversion mutation,,A coherent picture of cancer development gradually emerged.,MUTATED,6
Inversion mutation,,Benign polyps would develop if both copies of a certain gene were knocked out.,MUTATED,5
Inversion mutation,,"If the second gene's both copies were deleted then, the polyps would progress to malignancy.",MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,"It was clear that for colon cancer to develop, more than one gene had to be damaged.",MUTATED,7
Inversion mutation,,Other molecular biologists were galvanized by their report.,MUTATED,5
Inversion mutation,,"Ray White at Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Salt Lake City says, `` It was the confirming evidence we all needed to show that critical gene losses contribute to the development of a common tumor. ``",MUTATED,10
Inversion mutation,,"Yet to be nailed by Dr. Vogelstein was the identity of the gene that, when damaged, could flip a colon cell into full-blown malignancy.",MUTATED,10
Inversion mutation,,Chromosome 17 was the focus of their study.,MUTATED,1
,,,DUMP,
Inversion mutation,,A gene would probably be constituted by such a piece of DNA.,MUTATED,5
Inversion mutation,,Dr. Vogelstein was dubious that the search was over when they found it last winter.,MUTATED,5
Inversion mutation,,"The fact that several years earlier a Princeton University researcher, Arnold Levine, had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones was the source of his doubts.",MUTATED,16
Inversion mutation,,"In exactly the same spot as p53, Dr. Vogelstein found the deletion.",MUTATED,4
Inversion mutation,,"But Mr. Levine had said that cancer was caused by the p53 gene, which promotes growth, whereas the scientists at Johns Hopkins were searching for a gene that suppresses growth.",MUTATED,6
Inversion mutation,,"When the gene found in human cancer cells by the Johns Hopkins scientists was compared with Mr. Levine's p53 gene, they discovered the two to be identical; it was revealed that in his cancer studies, Mr. Levine had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of p53 -- a gene that suppresses cancer.",MUTATED,12
Inversion mutation,,"An obscure gene is suddenly put right in the cockpit of cancer formation by the discovery, says Robert Weinberg, a leading cancer-gene researcher at Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass.",MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,"The p53 suppressor gene is now emerging as evidence of involvement in other cancers, too.",MUTATED,6
Inversion mutation,,"In 23 of 38 breast tumors, researchers in Edinburgh, Scotland, found that one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies.",MUTATED,9
Inversion mutation,,"The scientists say that when inherited in a damaged form, the gene may predispose women to breast cancer, often striking multiple members of certain families.",MUTATED,14
Inversion mutation,,Lung cancer has just been implicated with the p53 gene.,MUTATED,5
,,,DUMP,
Inversion mutation,,"As yet unpublished, there are also reports from several labs of missing p53 genes in tissue taken from cancers of the kidney, brain, and skin.",MUTATED,12
Inversion mutation,,"At the same time, other tumor-suppressor genes are being rushed to be pinpointed by the Johns Hopkins team and others.",MUTATED,4
Inversion mutation,,"Dr. Vogelstein hopes to soon isolate one on chromosome 18, which is also involved in colon cancer.",MUTATED,7
Inversion mutation,,"Another gene involved with some types of colon cancer, thought to be on chromosome 5, is close to being found by Ray White in Utah and Walter Bodmer, a researcher in Great Britain.",MUTATED,9
Inversion mutation,,Dr. Minna believes that especially lung cancer is prone to those who inherit a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome 3.,MUTATED,10
Inversion mutation,,"The retinoblastoma suppressor gene, recently reported by him and others, may also be involved not only in some lung cancers but in several other more common cancers as well.",MUTATED,9
Inversion mutation,,Scientists can only speculate where these discoveries will lead.,MUTATED,5
Inversion mutation,,"Gene hunters are collaborating with two major pharmaceutical companies, the Squibb unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., to turn the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and, maybe, new therapies already.",MUTATED,16
Inversion mutation,,"New cancer drugs to slow or reverse tumor growth, say some researchers, may be based on the suppressor proteins normally produced by the genes.",MUTATED,14
Inversion mutation,,"The growth-controlling proteins made by healthy versions of the damaged genes would be administered to patients, according to the idea.",MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,"It may even be possible for healthy versions to replace defective genes, though no one has come close to achieving that so far.",MUTATED,6
Inversion mutation,,"One of the most important steps in the genesis of cancer, Dr. Minna of the National Cancer Institute says, is what we're witnessing the discovery of.",MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,"Why can our children not be taught to read, write, and reckon?",MUTATED,4
Inversion mutation,,"It's not that how to we do not know, because we do.",MUTATED,1
Inversion mutation,,That we do not want is it.,MUTATED,1
Inversion mutation,,"That we do not want to is due to the reason that to achieve effective education, we would need to surrender some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature, both in general and specifically regarding young people, as well as to challenge certain cherished vested interests.",MUTATED,12
Inversion mutation,,"It seems almost blasphemous to challenge these beliefs that so dominate our educational establishment, our media, our politicians, and even our parents.",MUTATED,12
Inversion mutation,,An example is here.,MUTATED,2
Inversion mutation,,"If a sample of American parents were asked, `` Do you wish for the elementary schools to encourage creativity in your children? `` the near-unanimous answer would be, `` Yes, of course. ``",MUTATED,9
Inversion mutation,,What do we specifically mean by `` creativity ``?,MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,No one can be certain.,MUTATED,1
Inversion mutation,,"In practice, a `` self-expression `` that is equated with encouraging the youngsters' `` self-esteem `` ends up being the result.",MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,"A generation of young people is the result, whose good opinion of themselves is only matched by their ignorance and intellectual incompetence.",MUTATED,11
Inversion mutation,,"A romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction, which was (and is) considered `` authoritarian, `` a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the undefined yet wonderful potentialities in the souls of all our children, has been (and is) integral to the whole notion of `` creativity `` in education.",MUTATED,16
Inversion mutation,,This romantic extravagance is not surprising that parents find so attractive.,MUTATED,5
Inversion mutation,,"Fortunately, their children are wanted by these same parents to receive a decent education as traditionally understood, and they possess enough common sense to recognize what that demands.",MUTATED,9
Inversion mutation,,Adolescent illiteracy cannot withstand their commitment to `` creativity ``.,MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,The degree to which we -- all of us -- allow this common sense to prevail over the illusions that we also share will determine the future of American education.,MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,"Every inch of the way, the education establishment will fight against common sense.",MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,"One simple reason ought not to be underestimated, although the reasons are complex.",MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,Far more interesting and agreeable to teachers than is disciplined instruction is what was once called Progressive education.,MUTATED,10
Inversion mutation,,It is nice for teachers to consider themselves as engaging in `` personality development `` and even nicer to minimize the often disappointing results of those irksome tests.,MUTATED,11
Inversion mutation,,"A superior self-definition as a `` profession `` is also provided to teachers, since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy.",MUTATED,9
Inversion mutation,,"Such courses in college did I myself take, thinking I might end up a schoolteacher.",MUTATED,6
Inversion mutation,,`` Pap `` courses could all fairly be described as them.,MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,"It is unfair, however, to dump on teachers, as opposed to the educational establishment.",MUTATED,5
Inversion mutation,,"Many schoolteachers, I know, are seriously committed, on the whole, to conscientious teaching.",MUTATED,7
Inversion mutation,,"Very few such people, by definition, may be among the 'best and brightest' of their generation.",MUTATED,6
Inversion mutation,,"Doing their jobs well, they need not be otherwise.",MUTATED,2
Inversion mutation,,"Yes, one or two truly inspiring teachers can we all remember from our school days.",MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,"But at the hands of those others, our education proceeded, who were merely competent and conscientious.",MUTATED,5
Inversion mutation,,"In this sense, one's family doctor can be compared to a teacher.",MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,He probably would not be a family doctor in the first place if he were brilliant.,MUTATED,2
Inversion mutation,,"If he serves us well, it is because he is competent and conscientious.",MUTATED,4
Inversion mutation,,Our educational crisis does not involve our teachers as an important factor.,MUTATED,5
Inversion mutation,,A problem of equity is whether they are or are not underpaid; it is not an educational problem.,MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,To think our teachers would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more is silly libel.,MUTATED,11
Inversion mutation,,The kind of libel the teachers' unions do not mind spreading is for their own narrow purposes.,MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,"The kind of libel that is also found useful by politicians helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency, since it is.",MUTATED,12
Inversion mutation,,"But no evidence exists that, when other things are equal, salary differentials cause educational differentials.",MUTATED,6
Inversion mutation,,"You can be sure that if there were such evidence, you would have heard of it.",MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,"To be serious about American education, we wish to know exactly what to do -- and, just as important, what not to do.",MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,"Scattered throughout this nation are many successful schools, some of which are in the poorest of ghettos, and they all send us the same message.",MUTATED,6
Inversion mutation,,"We know beforehand which efforts at educational reform are doomed, conversely, in the majority of unsuccessful schools.",MUTATED,9
Inversion mutation,,"If only we could assimilate this knowledge into our thinking, we really do know all we need to know.",MUTATED,6
Inversion mutation,,"In this respect, it would be more helpful if our political leaders were silent, rather than eloquently expressing `` concern. ``",MUTATED,6

Inversion mutation,,"At the recent governors' conference on education, it was announced by Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas that `` a comprehensive child-development policy for children under five is needed by this country. ``",MUTATED,10
Inversion mutation,,A more pressing need would seem to be a comprehensive development policy for governors over 30.,MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,"In effect, Gov. Clinton is advocating the extension of the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten years.",MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,"This is a child-care program, whether desirable or not, not an educational program.",MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,"That very early exposure to schooling improves performance in the first grade is known, but afterward, the difference is quickly washed away.",MUTATED,11
Inversion mutation,,Let us sum up what we know about education and about those reforms of education that work and those that do not: -- a bad idea is `` Parental involvement ``.,MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,Schools are too often blamed by parents for the educational limitations of their children.,MUTATED,7
Inversion mutation,,"At home, parents should be involved with their children's education, not in school.",MUTATED,5
Inversion mutation,,It should be seen to by them that their kids do not play truant; they should ensure that enough time is spent by the children on homework; they should scrutinize the report card.,MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,"If a school is not meeting the expectations of parents, the option of switching to another should be available to them.",MUTATED,4
Inversion mutation,,An even worse idea is community involvement.,MUTATED,5
Inversion mutation,,Decisive is the experience of New York City here.,MUTATED,2

Inversion mutation,,"A 20-year-old commitment to this system of school governance is being disengaged from by New York, even as Chicago and other cities move to institute it, with the city currently in the process of trying to do so.",MUTATED,9
Inversion mutation,,"In our current circumstances, it is probable that increasing education expenditures in most states will worsen things, not improve them.",MUTATED,6
Inversion mutation,,"The simple reason is this: in the classroom, where money's influence is minimal, education takes place.",MUTATED,7
Inversion mutation,,"Unequivocally, even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupils, as decades of educational research inform us -- though they may sometimes be desired for other reasons.",MUTATED,14
Inversion mutation,,"Into the already top-heavy administrative structure flows the new money, which keeps itself busy by piling more and more paper work on the teachers.",MUTATED,10
Inversion mutation,,"In the fact that educational performance has declined, there is neither mystery nor paradox as educational expenditures have increased sharply in real terms over the past quarter-of-a-century -- now spending more per pupil than any other country in the world.",MUTATED,15
Inversion mutation,,The system works that way.,MUTATED,2
Inversion mutation,,"As their academic potential allows, students should move up the educational ladder.",MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,No student should be graduated from elementary school and permitted to do so without having mastered the 3 R 's at the level that prevailed 20 years ago.,MUTATED,7

Inversion mutation,,"Another reminder that, at least at the federal level, political `` ticket splitting `` has been on the rise over the past half century is Tuesday's rout of a GOP congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district that hasn't backed a Democratic presidential candidate since Adlai Stevenson.",MUTATED,14
Inversion mutation,,"In only one presidential election year prior to 1948, more than 20 % of the nation's congressional districts selected a candidate from a different party for the White House than they did for the House of Representatives.",MUTATED,9
Inversion mutation,,"A third is routinely that percentage, and twice it has exceeded 40%.",MUTATED,1
Inversion mutation,,"Republicans are favored more by voters in races for president than in those for Congress, as is known.",MUTATED,6
Inversion mutation,,"A greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president has been captured by the GOP in every presidential election over the past half century, except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy, than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress.",MUTATED,11
Inversion mutation,,Nearly the opposite was the pattern prior to 1932.,MUTATED,2
Inversion mutation,,The results of recent decades are accounted for by what?,MUTATED,4
Inversion mutation,,At least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by Americans in the voting booth may be provided by a simple economic theory.,MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,Three assumptions are relied upon by the theory.,MUTATED,2
Inversion mutation,,"When selecting their political agents, voters can `` buy `` one of two brands -- a Republican brand that believes the minimalist state and private markets, with their virtues, are superior to public action and its vices, and a Democratic brand that advocates for big government and public intervention as a remedy to the excesses that come with pursuing private interest.",MUTATED,22
Inversion mutation,,"Two basic responsibilities are those of Congressional representatives while voting in office -- dealing with national issues, such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and/or confers benefits on the population at large, and attending to local issues including constituency service and pork barrel.",MUTATED,18
Inversion mutation,,"Because of their belief in a minimalist state, Republican congressional representatives are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than Democratic members of Congress.",MUTATED,9
Inversion mutation,,"What in economic theory is called a prisoner's dilemma faces voters in races for Congress if these assumptions hold, and they have an incentive, at the margin, to lean Democratic.",MUTATED,11
Inversion mutation,,"If a Republican is put into office, not only will their selected legislator be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from `` bringing home the bacon `` to their respective constituencies, but they will also acquire less in terms of local benefits.",MUTATED,12
Inversion mutation,,"When it comes to national policy making, each legislator is but one out of 535, after all.",MUTATED,5
Inversion mutation,,"Republican is the lean of a voter's incentive, at the margin, in races for the White House.",MUTATED,4
Inversion mutation,,"A GOP president, although likely more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home local benefits, may also limit such benefits to the voter's particular district/state.",MUTATED,12
Inversion mutation,,"Consequently, the individual voter's standing will be enhanced by lower taxes.",MUTATED,5
Inversion mutation,,It appears that this exceedingly simple theory can explain several things.,MUTATED,6
Inversion mutation,,"Why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century first: Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal, a much smaller role in society was occupied by government, and the prisoner's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe.",MUTATED,17
Inversion mutation,,"Second, it explains the disdain that voters hold for Congress yet their love for their own congressional representatives: the constituents of any legislator appreciate the specific benefits they gain from the legislator, but do not consider the overall cost that comes with every other legislator's actions on behalf of their respective constituencies.",MUTATED,18
Inversion mutation,,"The theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office, thirdly.",MUTATED,11
Inversion Mutation,,"Virtually immune to defeat have become first-term members of the House, the most vulnerable incumbents.",MUTATED,7
Inversion mutation,,The defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982 was the one exception to this recent trend.,MUTATED,11
Inversion mutation,,"Because these freshmen, in their role as partisans spreading the Reagan revolution, placed emphasis on national policy making, they were more vulnerable to defeat.",MUTATED,10
Inversion mutation,,"Why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office is indicated by the theory, fourth.",MUTATED,9
Inversion mutation,,Less may potential candidates be discouraged from running by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent.,MUTATED,11
Inversion mutation,,"To the extent that the congressional prisoner's dilemma game works to the disadvantage of potential Republican candidates and their financial backers, the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates, as they realize this.",MUTATED,13
Inversion mutation,,"At least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South may be provided by the theory, fifth.",MUTATED,4
Inversion mutation,,"To the extent that a disproportionate share of power in Congress has been held by Democratic legislators from the South since 1932 and they have been able to translate such clout into more local benefits for their respective constituencies, an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office has been had by voters in the South.",MUTATED,21
Inversion mutation,,"The theory suggests why, generally, Republicans have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House.",MUTATED,6
Inversion mutation,,"This is precisely the pattern one would expect since, in the lower chamber of Congress, local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making less, if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts.",MUTATED,12
Inversion mutation,,Does this theory have any empirical support?,MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,The key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues is corroborated by three pieces of evidence.,MUTATED,13
Inversion mutation,,"GOP senators turn back roughly 10% more of their allocated personal staff budgets than do Democrats, according to the findings of economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo.",MUTATED,6
Inversion mutation,,"To the extent that local benefit-seeking involves the primary duty of personal staff, this indicates that the political philosophy of congressional Republicans leads to less attention being paid to narrow constituent concerns.",MUTATED,15
Inversion mutation,,"To the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and take away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking, if the key assumption is valid, Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than do Republicans, second.",MUTATED,22
Inversion mutation,,"Indeed, this is what the data indicate, especially in the case of the House.",MUTATED,2
Inversion mutation,,The Republican House attendance rate has not been exceeded by the Democratic House attendance rate since 1959.,MUTATED,4
Inversion mutation,,"As shown in the table, a higher proportion of personal staffs are allocated by Democrats to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more than national policy making activities do in Washington offices, finally.",MUTATED,14
Inversion mutation,,"When control of the Senate changed party hands between 1986 and 1987, an examination reveals that the noted personal staffing differences in the table cannot be attributed to the Democrats' disproportionate control over other resources such as committee staff, due to their majority-party status, and moreover, these changes in staffing decisions are not solely a result of the party shift.",MUTATED,17
Inversion mutation,,"The Senate provides additional evidence: When holding constant factors such as incumbency advantages and regional differences, the discrepancy in popular votes between Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states with a Senate election is shown to be a positive function of the onerous federal tax burden per state — a progressive tax rate that impacts higher-income states more severely.",MUTATED,22
Inversion mutation,,"When the prisoner's dilemma is more severe, voters look upon GOP candidates for president more kindly than Republican candidates for the Senate, put more simply.",MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,The same peculiar pattern appears to be taken in ticket splitting at the state government level as at the federal level.,MUTATED,9
Inversion mutation,,"More typically, state government is split along Republican-governor / Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse situation occurs.",MUTATED,4
Inversion mutation,,"A positive function of the state tax rate is revealed by a cross-state econometric investigation, furthermore, to be the difference between the Republican gubernatorial candidate's share of the major-party vote in a state and the Republican share of the lower state house, holding other factors constant.",MUTATED,15
Inversion mutation,,"At least part of the seemingly irrational behavior that voters display in the voting booth, at both the federal and state government levels, may have an exceedingly rational explanation in sum.",MUTATED,13

Inversion mutation,,Fraud law and sport,MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,Such tricks as those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax demonstrate wittiness but not the will to remove a sanction.,MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,"Presumably forged by two players of Real Madrid, Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos, the expulsion in the game played on the 23rd of November against Ajax in the European Champions League has led to rivers of ink being spilled over whether such behavior is unsportsmanlike and if both players should face sanctions from UEFA.",MUTATED,5
Inversion mutation,,"As we all know, a few minutes before the end of the game, which their team had already won, both players deliberately wasted time, causing the referee to issue a second yellow card to each of them.",MUTATED,7
Inversion mutation,,"This way, as Real Madrid will emerge as the leader of its group, the next league game against Auxerre will see both players serving the required sanction, after which they can be free of the cards in the subsequent phase.",MUTATED,9
Inversion mutation,,"Jose Mourinho, the trainer of the team, has been sanctioned with two games by the UEFA committee of discipline, as have the implied players with different economic amounts.",MUTATED,7
Inversion mutation,,"In the world of football, it is not a new practice to see a yellow card provocation in circumstances similar to this one, but rather a frequent occurrence.",MUTATED,6
Inversion mutation,,"So extended is it that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, yet it is followed by this sport nonetheless.",MUTATED,3
Inversion mutation,,"The fact that the team of the Real Madrid organization, which presumes of nobility and honor in its hymn and has fined its players for analogous acts, has carried out, is a cause of the debate arisen in the related case, further dramatized, apparently, by Mourinho, adding one more incident to his history as a histrionic and provoking technician.",MUTATED,11
Inversion mutation,,"If that type of behavior not specifically prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of the sport, as the debate suggests, then it is respectful to the sport's regulation but seems to evade its spirit; that is to say, if these actions constitute fraud.",MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,The type of damage that is brought to the sporting spirit is examined by the matter.,MUTATED,4
Inversion mutation,,"The physical integrity of the opposite players, an aspect that includes the sport spirit as one of its advantages, was not put into danger by these actions, meaning there was no violent game.",MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,"It is alluded to another of these advantages with the fare-play, to avoid the team of lawbreaker players taking advantage unjustly of the opposite team, which did not happen either.",MUTATED,4
Inversion mutation,,"However, the paradoxical thing is that the action of the players of Real Madrid did not comply with what we normally characterize as legal fraud, because the rules were violated not secretly to try and avoid the sanction, but most evidently, leading to punishment from the referee.",MUTATED,7
Inversion mutation,,"The sanction was accepted by them without complaints, for which they waited.",MUTATED,2
Inversion mutation,,What type of advantage the violators obtained in the actions deliberately carried out is another question.,MUTATED,5
Inversion mutation,,"It seems necessary to state here that neither is it a disadvantageous situation for the rival nor is an obtained benefit in the same game, because evidently the action's result supposes their own team with fewer players remaining.",MUTATED,7
Inversion mutation,,"And it is not a useful strategy for the next game either, because those players will not be counted on by the club.",MUTATED,4
Inversion mutation,,"Obviously, the fact that the players will start the next phase of the Championship without cards that could endanger their participation in a future game is the advantage.",MUTATED,8
Inversion mutation,,"But it is about a long-term advantage with a certain degree of indetermination, because the change can eliminate the team first, and in addition, the players fulfill a sanction game with this action, proceeding to the second cycle of cards where the suspension due to card accumulation occurs with one less than in the initial cycle.",MUTATED,14
Inversion mutation,,So that it is an advantage is not so clear by passing rounds.,MUTATED,2
Inversion mutation,,"Really, those actions are against the sporting spirit, which is part of strategic decisions favoring the advantages allowed by the rules.",MUTATED,6
Inversion mutation,,"The players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction regarding this assumption, but rather chose when to obey it, which would have been a clear case of legal fraud.",MUTATED,5
Inversion mutation,,A strategic decision was made by them without avoiding the punishment.,MUTATED,2
Inversion mutation,,"Although the border between wittiness and law fraud is diffuse, on this occasion I believe it to be a clear case of wittiness.",MUTATED,6
Inversion mutation,,The controversy seems to stem from two factors: the manner in which the directive was transmitted and the fact that it led to two auto expulsions.,MUTATED,4

Inversion mutation,,"The bacteria known as GFAJ-1 was collected by the researchers and exposed to increasing concentrations of arsenic, to which it adapted and grew.",MUTATED,4
Inversion mutation,,"That a microbe can live with arsenic instead of phosphorus raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic could occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common, although it does grow better on phosphorus.",MUTATED,6
