Modifier mutation,,"ASLACTON, peacefully located in England --",MUTATED,1
Modifier mutation,,"Of all scenes that vividly evoke rural England, this remains one of the loveliest: An ancient stone church proudly stands amidst the lush fields, the clear sound of bells cascading down from its towering spire, beckoning the faithful to evensong.",MUTATED,14
Modifier mutation,,"The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels frequently stop to chat at the church door, as the members here always do.",MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,"In the tower, five men and women pull rhythmically and diligently on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614.",MUTATED,12

Modifier mutation,,"The others here today, however, live elsewhere.",MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,They belong to a dedicated group of 15 ringers -- including two octogenarians and four enthusiastic youngsters in training -- who drive every Sunday tirelessly from church to church in a sometimes-exhausting effort to keep the bells resonant in the many belfries of East Anglia.,MUTATED,14

Modifier mutation,,"The less complicated version of playing tunes on bells, as do the carillons of continental Europe, is widely considered by the English to be childish, fit only for foreigners.",MUTATED,15
Modifier mutation,,"Change-ringing, an astonishingly complex exercise the English invented 380 years ago, demands considerable physical dexterity -- with bells weighing more than a ton -- and intense mental concentration.",MUTATED,14

Modifier mutation,,"One survey suggests that, of the approximately 100,000 trained bellringers in England today, merely 40,000 of them continue to ring.",MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,"Also, the bells in small, rural parishes and inner-city churches do not always need to be rung by local ringers.",MUTATED,10
Modifier mutation,,"But the council's program to attract and train ringers is only marginally successful, says Mr. Baldwin.",MUTATED,9
Modifier mutation,,"Right now, we're especially lucky if after five years we manage to keep even one new ringer out of 10, he adds.",MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,"One significant bright sign is that an increasingly growing number of women have entered the once male-dominated field; more than a third of the ringers present today are, in fact, women.",MUTATED,11
Modifier mutation,,"They are, however, not accepted everywhere.",MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,"The oldest bell-ringing group in the country, the Ancient Society of College Youths, which was founded in 1637, still remains exclusively male, a fact that's especially galling to women since the group is the primary source of ringers for Britain's most prestigious churches, including St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey.",MUTATED,13
Modifier mutation,,"This being Britain, no woman has yet filed an equal-opportunity suit, yet the full extent of the problem emerged this summer through a series of letters in 'The Ringing World,' a weekly newspaper cherished by ringers.",MUTATED,13
Modifier mutation,,"One writer, signing his letter rather confidently as 'Red-blooded, balanced male,' remarked on the 'startling frequency of women fainting in peals,' and suggested that they 'calmly settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings.'",MUTATED,17

Modifier mutation,,"Medical scientists are gradually starting to uncover a handful of genes which, if damaged, potentially unleash the chaotic growth of cells that characterizes cancer.",MUTATED,12
Modifier mutation,,Scientists say the recent discovery of these genes is painting an increasingly new and startling picture of how cancer develops.,MUTATED,10
Modifier mutation,,An emerging and rapidly evolving understanding of the genes is expected to produce a diverse array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention.,MUTATED,12
Modifier mutation,,That is clearly for the future.,MUTATED,1
Modifier mutation,,"Already, scientists are actively developing tests based on the newly identified genes that, for the first time, can reliably predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is likely to develop cancer.",MUTATED,16
Modifier mutation,,"It's an incredibly exciting set of discoveries, says Bert Vogelstein, a renowned researcher from Johns Hopkins University who has just discovered a gene crucial for triggering colon cancer.",MUTATED,9
Modifier mutation,,"Only a decade ago, cancer remained a mysterious black box, about which we knew virtually nothing at the molecular level.",MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,"Today, we increasingly understand that the gradual accumulation of several specific altered genes can potentially initiate cancer and, subsequently, drive it towards a fatally aggressive state.",MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,"Scientists commonly call the new class of genes tumor-suppressors, or simply anti-cancer genes.",MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,"When functioning normally, they continuously make proteins that effectively hold a cell's growth in check.",MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,"But if the genes are significantly damaged -- perhaps by radiation, a chemical, or due to a random accident during cell division -- their growth-suppressing proteins no longer function properly, causing cells that would normally remain in check to turn malignant.",MUTATED,12
Modifier mutation,,The newly identified genes significantly differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes.,MUTATED,9
Modifier mutation,,"Oncogenes necessarily need to be present for a cell to transform into a malignant state, yet researchers have discovered them in both normal and cancerous cells, intriguingly suggesting that oncogenes alone may not be the direct cause of cancer.",MUTATED,10
Modifier mutation,,"In recent months, researchers have increasingly come to believe that the two specific types of cancer genes work in concert: An oncogene may turn normally proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been significantly damaged.",MUTATED,16
Modifier mutation,,"Like all genes, each tumor-suppressor gene is inherited in a pair of copies, with one from each parent.",MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,"Either copy can effectively make the proteins needed to control cell growth, thus for cancer to arise, both copies must be significantly impaired.",MUTATED,9
Modifier mutation,,"A person born with a single defective copy of a suppressor gene, or one who sustains damage to a copy early in life, is particularly susceptible to cancer since he merely needs to lose the remaining copy for cancer to potentially develop.",MUTATED,11
Modifier mutation,,"Emerging genetic tests will potentially be able to spot such cancer-susceptible individuals, potentially ushering in what some scientists believe is a new age of predictive cancer diagnosis.",MUTATED,13
Modifier mutation,,Bill and Bonnie Quinlan are likely the very first beneficiaries of the new findings.,MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,"The Dedham, Mass. couple knew even before Bonnie became pregnant in 1987 that any child of theirs had a relatively high 50% chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma, an eye cancer that occurs approximately once in every 20,000 births.",MUTATED,15
Modifier mutation,,"Mr. Quinlan, 30 years old, knew he carried a damaged gene, having unfortunately lost an eye to the rare tumor when he was only two months old -- after his mother had similarly suffered the same fate as a baby.",MUTATED,13
Modifier mutation,,"Because of the complete isolation of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, it finally became possible last January to precisely determine what threat the Quinlan baby faced.",MUTATED,10
Modifier mutation,,"A recent test using new `` genetic probes `` has conclusively shown that little Will Quinlan had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene and, therefore, faced no additional risk compared to other children in developing the rare cancer.",MUTATED,16
Modifier mutation,,"It truly made our New Year, says Mr. Quinlan.",MUTATED,2
Modifier mutation,,This test was the first reliably to predict whether an individual could expect to develop cancer.,MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,"Equally important, the initial discovery of the gene controlling retinal cell growth, made by a renowned Boston doctor named Thaddeus Dryja, has significantly opened up a field of cancer study, which in recent months has rapidly exploded.",MUTATED,19
,,,DUMP,
Modifier mutation,,"All this may not be immediately obvious to the public, which is eagerly concerned about advances in treatment, but I am firmly convinced that this basic research will soon begin showing significant results there.",MUTATED,11
Modifier mutation,,"To date, scientists have specifically fingered two key cancer-suppressors.",MUTATED,1
Modifier mutation,,Dr. Dryja made a groundbreaking retinoblastoma discovery in 1986.,MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,"Then last spring, researchers reported the discovery of a gene called p53, which, when impaired, has the potential to transform healthy colon cells into cancerous ones.",MUTATED,12
Modifier mutation,,"Soon after that report, two additional research teams meticulously uncovered evidence indicating that the same damaged p53 gene is consistently present in tissue from both lung and breast cancers.",MUTATED,12
Modifier mutation,,"Colon, lung, and breast cancers are among the most prevalent and deadliest forms of the disease, collectively resulting in the deaths of nearly 200,000 Americans each year.",MUTATED,10
Modifier mutation,,"Right now, approximately a dozen high-tech laboratories in the U.S., Canada, and Britain are eagerly racing to uncover other potential tumor-suppressing genes.",MUTATED,10
Modifier mutation,,They approximately have seven candidates.,MUTATED,0
Modifier mutation,,"Researchers say that the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes, either alone or in specific combinations, seems to play a crucial role in the development of various forms of cancer, including those affecting the brain, skin, kidney, prostate, and cervix.",MUTATED,13
Modifier mutation,,"There is compelling evidence that if people inherit seriously defective versions of these genes, they are especially vulnerable to cancer, perhaps ultimately explaining why some cancers seem to persistently haunt certain families.",MUTATED,14
Modifier mutation,,"The story of tumor-suppressor genes dates back to the mid-1970s, when a renowned pediatrician named Alfred G. Knudson Jr. first proposed that retinoblastoma could arise from two distinct genetic defects.",MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,"He speculated that in some eye cancers, an infant might inherit a defective copy of a gene from one parent and a healthy copy from the other.",MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,"The tumor, he suggested, may have developed when the second, seemingly normal copy was also damaged.",MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,But there was simply no way to prove Dr. Knudson's `` two-hit `` theory.,MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,"Back then, scientists had no precise way to isolate specific genes, yet under a powerful microscope they could visualize the 23 pairs of chromosomes within the cells that contain those genes.",MUTATED,11
Modifier mutation,,"Occasionally, clearly visible gross chromosome damage was observed.",MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,Dr. Knudson discovered that certain children afflicted with eye cancer had inherited a faulty copy of chromosome No. 13 from a parent previously affected by the disease.,MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,"Under a powerful microscope, he could actually notice that a significant bit of chromosome 13 was missing.",MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,He assumed that the missing piece likely contained a gene or genes whose loss played a critical role in triggering the cancer.,MUTATED,9
Modifier mutation,,But he did not exactly know which gene or genes had disappeared.,MUTATED,2
Modifier mutation,,"Then, a scientific team, led by the renowned molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee, based at the University of Utah, ultimately found the answer.",MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,"The team effectively used a battery of the newly developed `` gene probes , `` snippets of genetic material that can precisely track a gene 's presence in a cell .",MUTATED,12
Modifier mutation,,"By meticulously analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors, they pinpointed defects in the second copy of chromosome 13 in the precise area corresponding to the first copy of the chromosome.",MUTATED,11
Modifier mutation,,The significant finding captivated modern medicine.,MUTATED,2
Modifier mutation,,It was the first time anyone had clearly showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could potentially lead to the eruption of a cancer.,MUTATED,10
Modifier mutation,,"It was extraordinarily and unexpectedly satisfying, says Dr. Knudson, now working at Fox Chase Cancer Research Center in Philadelphia.",MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,I was thoroughly convinced that what was truly true of retinoblastoma would likely be true for all other cancers.,MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,It truly was an audacious claim.,MUTATED,2
Modifier mutation,,"But in Baltimore, Dr. Vogelstein, a young and brilliant molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School, firmly believed that Dr. Knudson was right, and diligently set out to repeat the Cavenee experiment in cells from various other cancers.",MUTATED,10
Modifier mutation,,"His was one of two prominent research teams in 1984 to report the dual chromosome losses in a rare form of childhood cancer affecting the kidney, known as Wilm's tumor.",MUTATED,11
Modifier mutation,,"Dr. Vogelstein next turned his careful attention to colon cancer, which is the second largest cancer killer in the U.S., following lung cancer.",MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,"He believed that colon cancer might also gradually arise from multiple `` hits `` on cancer suppressor genes, because it often seems to develop in a series of stages.",MUTATED,10
Modifier mutation,,"It is often preceded by the gradual development of polyps in the bowel, which in certain cases become increasingly aggressive in clearly identifiable stages -- progressing from relatively less severe to potentially deadly -- as if a sequence of accumulating genetic damage might be occurring.",MUTATED,15
Modifier mutation,,"Dr. Vogelstein and his doctoral student, Eric Fearon, embarked on months of meticulous and frequently frustrating probing of the chromosomes in search of signs of genetic damage.",MUTATED,10
Modifier mutation,,"They gradually began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions, some exclusively existing in benign polyps, others in malignant cells, and many in both types of polyps and malignant cells.",MUTATED,9
Modifier mutation,,"Gradually, a more coherent picture of the complexities in cancer development emerged.",MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,"If both copies of a certain critical gene were knocked out, eventually benign polyps would develop.",MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,"If both copies of a second critical gene were subsequently deleted, the polyps could progress to malignancy.",MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,It was clear that significantly more than one gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop.,MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,Their groundbreaking report galvanized other molecular biologists.,MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,"It was the crucial confirming evidence we all needed to establish that gene losses were critical in the development of a common tumor, `` says Ray White at Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Salt Lake City.",MUTATED,10
Modifier mutation,,"But Dr. Vogelstein had not yet conclusively identified the gene that, when damaged, triggered a colon cell's transformation into full-blown malignancy.",MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,They specifically focused on chromosome 17.,MUTATED,1
Modifier mutation,,"For months, the dedicated Johns Hopkins researchers meticulously used gene probes to experimentally trace the length of chromosome 17, searching for the smallest common bit of genetic material that is typically lost in all tumor cells.",MUTATED,14
Modifier mutation,,Such a piece of DNA could likely constitute a gene.,MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,"When they finally found it last winter, Dr. Vogelstein was dubious if the search was truly over.",MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,"His considerable doubts stemmed from the fact that several years earlier a Princeton University researcher, Arnold Levine, had discovered in rigorous experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones.",MUTATED,16
Modifier mutation,,Dr. Vogelstein discovered the deletion in precisely the identical spot as p53.,MUTATED,1
Modifier mutation,,"But Mr. Levine had repeatedly said that the p53 gene caused cancer by actively promoting growth, whereas the dedicated scientists at Johns Hopkins were diligently looking for a gene that specifically suppressed tumor growth.",MUTATED,9
Modifier mutation,,"Despite that, when the Johns Hopkins scientists meticulously compared the gene they had discovered in human cancer cells with Mr. Levine's p53 gene, they discovered the two were identical; it turned out that in Mr. Levine's cancer studies, he had unknowingly been observing a slightly altered form of p53 -- a cancer-suppressing gene.",MUTATED,11
Modifier mutation,,"The discovery quite suddenly puts an obscure gene directly in the cockpit of cancer formation, says Robert Weinberg, a prominent leader in cancer-gene research at Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass.",MUTATED,10
Modifier mutation,,Evidence is now increasingly emerging to suggest that the p53 suppressor gene is also involved in other types of cancers.,MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,"Researchers in Edinburgh, Scotland, have discovered that in 23 out of 38 breast tumors, a single copy of chromosome 17 exhibited a mutation in the precise location of the p53 gene.",MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,"The scientists say that breast cancer frequently strikes multiple members of certain families, suggesting that the gene, when inherited in a defective form, may particularly predispose women to the cancer.",MUTATED,13
Modifier mutation,,The p53 gene has only recently been implicated in lung cancer.,MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,"In a report published last week, John Minna and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute reportedly say that approximately half the cells sampled from lung cancer tissue they tested lack this gene.",MUTATED,11
Modifier mutation,,"There also are preliminary reports from several labs, as yet unpublished, detailing missing p53 genes in tissue samples taken from kidney, brain, and skin cancers.",MUTATED,12
Modifier mutation,,"Simultaneously, the Johns Hopkins team and others are eagerly rushing to identify additional tumor-suppressor genes.",MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,"Dr. Vogelstein hopes to soon isolate one on chromosome 18, which is also involved in colon cancer.",MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,"Ray White in Utah and Walter Bodmer, a leading researcher in Great Britain, are closely approaching the discovery of another gene involved with certain types of colon cancer, believed to be located on chromosome 5.",MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,"Dr. Minna firmly believes that people who inherit a defective gene, somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome 3, are particularly susceptible to lung cancer.",MUTATED,10
Modifier mutation,,"Recently, he and others have also reported that the retinoblastoma suppressor gene is potentially involved in certain aggressive lung cancers, along with several other frequently occurring cancers.",MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,"Where exactly these discoveries will lead, scientists can only vaguely speculate.",MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,"Already, two major pharmaceutical companies, including the Squibb unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., actively collaborate with gene hunters to transform the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and, perhaps, innovative new therapies.",MUTATED,14
Modifier mutation,,"Some researchers claim that new cancer drugs, which potentially slow or reverse tumor growth, are likely based on the suppressor proteins that are normally produced by the genes.",MUTATED,13
Modifier mutation,,"The idea would be to carefully administer growth-controlling proteins, made by healthy versions of the damaged genes, to patients.",MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,"It may even be remotely possible to replace defective genes with healthier versions, though no one has come close to doing that so far.",MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,"In any case, Dr. Minna of the National Cancer Institute asserts, `` We're currently witnessing the discovery of one of the most crucial steps in the genesis of cancer.",MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,"Why can not we effectively teach our children to read, write, and reckon?",MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,"It's not that we do not know how to, because we actually do.",MUTATED,1
Modifier mutation,,It's simply that we do not want to.,MUTATED,1
Modifier mutation,,"And the primary reason we do not want to is that truly effective education would necessarily require us to relinquish certain deeply cherished metaphysical beliefs regarding human nature, both in its general sense and especially in the case of young people, as well as to challenge some strongly held vested interests.",MUTATED,14

Modifier mutation,,The result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence is alarmingly matched only by their exceedingly good opinion of themselves.,MUTATED,11
Modifier mutation,,"The whole notion of `` creativity `` in education was ( and is ) an essential part of a passionate rebellion against rigidly authoritarian instruction, which was ( and is ) seen as a suppressor and source of frustration for the latent talents and the vast, if yet untapped, potentialities inherent in the impressionable souls of all our children.",MUTATED,14
Modifier mutation,,It is not at all surprising that parents find this romantic extravagance incredibly attractive.,MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,"Fortunately, these same parents genuinely want their children to receive a decent education as traditionally understood, and they have enough common sense to fully grasp what that demands.",MUTATED,9

Modifier mutation,,The education establishment will doggedly fight against common sense every inch of the way.,MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,"The reasons are indeed complex, yet one simple reason should not be underestimated.",MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,"Progressive education, as it was once called, is not only far more interesting but also more agreeable to teachers than is disciplined instruction.",MUTATED,10
Modifier mutation,,It is truly nice for teachers to believe they are engaged in 'personality development' and even nicer to effectively minimize those irksome tests with their often disappointing outcomes.,MUTATED,9
Modifier mutation,,"It also provides teachers with an enhanced sense of self as a `` profession , `` considering they have successfully completed advanced courses in educational psychology and philosophy.",MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,"I myself eagerly took such courses in college, thinking I might end up a schoolteacher.",MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,They could all quite fairly be described as `` pap `` courses.,MUTATED,3

Modifier mutation,,"I know many schoolteachers and, on the whole, they are quite seriously committed to diligent teaching.",MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,"They may not be among the very best and brightest of their generation -- there are, by definition, very few such people.",MUTATED,7

Modifier mutation,,Our teachers are a crucial factor in our ongoing educational crisis.,MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,Whether they are significantly underpaid is indeed a problem of equity; it is not merely an educational problem.,MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,It is truly silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children more effectively if only they got a few thousand dollars a year extra.,MUTATED,11
Modifier mutation,,"It is the kind of libel the teachers' unions gleefully spread for their own narrow purposes, not minding the consequences.",MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,"It is also the kind of libel that politicians particularly find useful, since it consistently helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency.",MUTATED,13

Modifier mutation,,There is not only mystery but also paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures ( in real terms ) have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century -- we now spend substantially more per pupil than any other country in the world -- educational performance has declined.,MUTATED,16

Modifier mutation,,No student should be easily permitted to be graduated from elementary school without having thoroughly mastered the 3 R 's at the level that prevailed 20 years ago.,MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,"This means `` tracking , `` whose main purpose is primarily to ensure that the less gifted obtain the necessary foundation for further study or for entering the modern world of work , albeit with the added benefit of potentially allowing gifted youngsters to flourish , which is clearly desirable.",MUTATED,14
Modifier mutation,,The absurd notion that tracking is somehow undemocratic is quite laughable.,MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,The primary purpose of education is fundamentally to encourage young men and women to fully realize their academic potential.,MUTATED,9
Modifier mutation,,No one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an inherently equal academic potential.,MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,"It is generally considered more desirable to use older textbooks -- many of them, unfortunately, out of print -- rather than the newer ones.",MUTATED,8

Modifier mutation,,They are rather based on dubious psychological and sociological theories than on educational experience.,MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,"One of the primary reasons why American students perform so poorly in math tests, as compared with their British, French, German, or Japanese counterparts, stems from the profound influence of the `` New Math `` on American textbooks and teaching methodologies.",MUTATED,10

Modifier mutation,,"Mr. Kristol, a prominent American Enterprise Institute fellow, co-edits The Public Interest and frequently publishes The National Interest.",MUTATED,1
Modifier mutation,,That's exactly what the man had said.,MUTATED,2
Modifier mutation,,"Haney peered somewhat doubtfully at his drinking companion through bleary, tear-filled eyes.",MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,"He had no immediate answer, as much from sheer surprise as from the sudden fit of coughing.",MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,Was the man excessively drunk or genuinely crazy or perhaps even both?,MUTATED,1
Modifier mutation,,"But his new-found buddy had eagerly matched him drink for drink until he lost count, and the man's eyes remained remarkably clear.",MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,"The guy is completely off his rocker, Haney thought to himself, and briefly looked away from those eyes.",MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,"Eyes that were not only clear but also dazzling with a strange intensity, a sort of cold, fiery passion burning behind them.",MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,Why had he not noticed it earlier?,MUTATED,1
Modifier mutation,,"No, the man was clearly not drunk",MUTATED,2
Modifier mutation,,He wondered how exactly he got tied up with this stranger.,MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,"But, naturally, he now remembered.",MUTATED,1
Modifier mutation,,"It was quite blurred, after two hours of steady drinking, but the memory of the occasion gradually came back to him.",MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,"The stranger, his head seemingly sunk in deep thought, began to cross the street illegally just as a huge moving van roared through the busy intersection.",MUTATED,9
Modifier mutation,,"Brakes howled and a horn blared furiously, but the man would have been gravely hit if Phil hadn't called out to him just a second before.",MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,"His shout had been quite involuntary, something anybody might have done without thinking, on the spur of the moment.",MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,"As a matter of fact, he would n't have cared remotely if the guy had been hit.",MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,"Actually, he regretted having opened his mouth as the truck abruptly came to a stop and the愤怒driver stormed down from the cab and walked back toward them.",MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,"By then, the stranger was profusely thanking Haney and had one arm tightly around his shoulders as if he were a long-lost old friend.",MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,So the driver started to curse loudly at both of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin his otherwise spotless safe-driving record.,MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,"Then the man he bravely saved turned and looked squarely into the truck driver's face, without saying a word.",MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,"Very suddenly, the driver abruptly stopped swearing at them, turned on his heel, and calmly went back to his truck.",MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,Haney hadn't given it much consideration at the time.,MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,"Now he vividly recalled it, and wondered exactly what the truck driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off.",MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,It must have been the sort of look that can effortlessly call a bluff without saying a word.,MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,"When the light conveniently went their way, they continued on across the street.",MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,"And when the stranger discovered that Phil was heading towards one of his favorite bars, he kindly insisted on buying drinks for both of them.",MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,"Phil typically went alone and silently kept to himself, sitting in a dim corner and methodically passing the time by nursing his favorite grudges.",MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,"But he decided he wouldn't mind some company in exchange for free drinks, even though he made quite good money at his job.",MUTATED,9
Modifier mutation,,Phil was always like that.,MUTATED,0
Modifier mutation,,"Now he idly wondered if it was worth it, having a screwball for company.",MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,"He really didn't take the offer seriously at first, but eventually began to feel uneasy.",MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,"When he finally got the coughing under control, he realized that Pete -LRB- all he gave was his first name -RRB- was still patiently waiting for an answer -- he didn't even seem to wink as he continued to intently stare.",MUTATED,9
Modifier mutation,,Haney barely managed a weak laugh.,MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,"Guess I really ca n't think of anyone, Pete.",MUTATED,1
Modifier mutation,,Thanks quite anyhow,MUTATED,1
Modifier mutation,,A faint crease gradually appeared between the man's eyebrows.,MUTATED,5

Modifier mutation,,"It's actually my line of work, he said",MUTATED,1
Modifier mutation,,"Five minutes later, just before Haney could make his break, the stranger stood up and nodded a polite farewell.",MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,"Haney carefully watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently, and felt relieved to see that nobody else appeared to notice his departure.",MUTATED,11
Modifier mutation,,"Phil decided to stay a little longer , and as time passed it increasingly seemed as if the strange little man had never been there , but for the other glass left on the table .",MUTATED,11
Modifier mutation,,"Some time shortly before midnight, he wearily returned to his apartment and hit the sack, putting the entire incident out of his mind as he drifted off to sleep.",MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,"The next day, Sunday, the severe hangover reminded Haney where he had been the night before.",MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,"The hangover consequently reminded him of his peculiar conversation with the weirdy, and he groaned.",MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,"He went reluctantly for more aspirin later in the day, and passed the surly landlord on the way -- he was still very much alive and scowling as usual, as if tenants were a constant burden in his life.",MUTATED,9

Modifier mutation,,He reluctantly went back to work on Monday.,MUTATED,0
Modifier mutation,,"By Wednesday, the landlord was somehow still alive.",MUTATED,2

Modifier mutation,,"He muttered something about how utterly terrible it was, and walked with a deliberate, leisurely slowness to the elevator.",MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,"Once inside his apartment, he poured a drink rather unsteadily with trembling hands and flopped limply into a chair.",MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,"After a while he began to feel slightly better about it, especially when no one bothered to ask any questions.",MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,"But after all, why necessarily should they?",MUTATED,0

Modifier mutation,,"Haney felt increasingly like shrinking out of sight, but he was already firmly trapped in the dark corner with the wiry, little man.",MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,He began to fervently wish that he hadn't shouted that other evening when the truck rapidly bore down through the crossing.,MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,Was he going to be perpetually saddled from now on with a complete creep for a bar-buddy?,MUTATED,2
Modifier mutation,,He'd have to start frequently going to some of the other places again.,MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,"In a low, nearly whispering voice, the man had gently asked Phil if he was truly happy with the way the landlord had been removed from his back.",MUTATED,8

Modifier mutation,,"Tuesday's overwhelming defeat of a GOP congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district, which hasn't supported a Democratic presidential candidate since Adlai Stevenson, serves as yet another stark reminder that, particularly at the federal level, political 'ticket splitting' has increasingly occurred over the past half century.",MUTATED,11
Modifier mutation,,"In just a single presidential election year before 1948, over 20 % of the nation's congressional districts selected a different party's candidate for the White House, distinct from their choice for the House of Representatives.",MUTATED,9
Modifier mutation,,Now that percentage consistently equals a third and has twice exceeded 40%.,MUTATED,2
Modifier mutation,,"As we know, voters tend to strongly favor Republicans in races for president more than in those for Congress.",MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,"In every presidential election over the past half century, with the notable exception of the Goldwater presidential candidacy, the GOP has consistently captured a significantly greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress.",MUTATED,11
Modifier mutation,,"Prior to 1932, the pattern was almost entirely the opposite.",MUTATED,2
Modifier mutation,,How significantly do accounts explain the results of recent decades?,MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,A simple yet powerful economic theory may at least partially explain the split personality displayed by Americans in the voting booth.,MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,The theory heavily relies on three basic assumptions:,MUTATED,2
Modifier mutation,,"Voters can readily `` buy `` one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that fundamentally believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action, and a Democratic brand that strongly believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest.",MUTATED,23
Modifier mutation,,Congressional representatives have two fundamental responsibilities during their time in office -- primarily dealing with national issues (such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and/or confers benefits on the general population) and also attending to local concerns (including constituency service and pork barrel projects).,MUTATED,17
Modifier mutation,,"3 -RRB- Republican congressional representatives, due to their firm belief in a minimalist state, are notably less willing to actively engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts in Congress.",MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,"If these assumptions hold, voters in closely contested races for Congress face what is commonly termed a prisoner's dilemma in economic theory, and thus have a strong incentive, particularly at the margin, to lean Democratic.",MUTATED,11
Modifier mutation,,"If they were to put a seasoned Republican into office, not only would they acquire fewer local benefits, but their chosen legislator will also be comparatively powerless to prevent other legislators from eagerly 'bringing home the bacon' to their respective constituencies.",MUTATED,11
Modifier mutation,,"Each legislator, after all, is merely a single voice out of 535 in the realm of national policy making.",MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,"In highly competitive races for the White House, a voter's incentive, even at the narrowest margin, is to lean Republican.",MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,"Although a GOP president may potentially limit local benefits to the voter's particular district/state, such a president is also likely to be particularly effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits.",MUTATED,12
Modifier mutation,,The individual voter's standing will consequently be significantly enhanced by lower taxes.,MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,"While this theory is exceedingly simple, it actually appears to explain several complex things.",MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,"First, consider why ticket splitting has increasingly taken on the peculiar pattern it has exhibited over the past half century: Prior to Franklin Roosevelt's election as president and the subsequent advent of the New Deal, the government played a significantly less prominent role in society, thereby making the prisoner's dilemma problem facing voters in Congressional races somewhat less severe.",MUTATED,14
Modifier mutation,,"Second, it succinctly explains why voters hold Congress in disdain yet generally adore their own congressional representatives: Any individual legislator's constituents genuinely appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator secures for them, while largely ignoring the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing the same for his or her own constituency.",MUTATED,19
Modifier mutation,,"Third, the theory suggests that legislators who excessively focus on national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking tend to have lower security in office.",MUTATED,10
Modifier mutation,,"For example, first-term members of the House, once the particularly vulnerable incumbents, have virtually become immune to defeat.",MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,The one notable exception to this recent political trend was the sound defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans who were brought into office in 1980 as part of the Reagan revolution and subsequently ran for re-election in 1982.,MUTATED,10
Modifier mutation,,"Because these freshmen placed a significant emphasis on their partisan role -- actively spreading the Reagan revolution -- in national policy making, they were particularly vulnerable to defeat.",MUTATED,10
Modifier mutation,,"Fourth, the theory indicates that the Republican Party may consistently have a difficult time attracting truly viable candidates for congressional office.",MUTATED,10
Modifier mutation,,"Potential candidates might be seriously discouraged from running primarily by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent, rather than by the meager congressional salary.",MUTATED,11
Modifier mutation,,"To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers fully realize that the congressional prisoner's dilemma game inherently works to their disadvantage, the Republican Party will be significantly hindered in its attempts to present a competitive slate of congressional candidates.",MUTATED,13
Modifier mutation,,"Fifth, the theory may at least partially provide a reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South.",MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,"To the extent that Southern Democratic legislators have retained an unfairly large share of power in Congress since 1932 and have effectively translated this influence into numerous local benefits within their constituencies, the voters in the South have had a particularly compelling reason to maintain such Democrats in office.",MUTATED,14
Modifier mutation,,"Finally, the theory suggests that Republicans have generally fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House.",MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,"Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress, this is precisely the pattern one would expect when Republicans are particularly less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts.",MUTATED,12
Modifier mutation,,Is there strong empirical support for this theory?,MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,Three pieces of crucial evidence strongly corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are notably more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues.,MUTATED,13
Modifier mutation,,"First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo discover that GOP senators actually retain roughly 10% more of their allocated personal staff budgets compared to what Democrats typically do.",MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,"To a significant extent, when the primary duty of personal staff primarily involves local benefit-seeking, this clearly indicates that their political philosophy tends to lead congressional Republicans to pay less attention to specific constituent concerns.",MUTATED,15
Modifier mutation,,"Second, if the key assumption isValid, Democrats generally have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans, to the extent that such votes significantly reflect national policy making and participating in them often takes away time a legislator might otherwise spend on local benefit-seeking.",MUTATED,21
Modifier mutation,,"This is indeed what the data clearly indicate, especially in the case of the House.",MUTATED,2
Modifier mutation,,The Democratic House attendance rate has never exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959.,MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,"Finally, as clearly shown in the table, Democrats consistently allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties are prioritized and national policy-making activities take a back seat to those in Washington offices.",MUTATED,12
Modifier mutation,,"An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate from 1986 to 1987 -LRB- when the control of that body shifted party hands -RRB- , however, indicates that the staffing differences noted in the table are not solely attributed to the excessive control Democrats exert, because of their majority-party status, over other resources including committee staff.",MUTATED,18
Modifier mutation,,"An intriguing additional piece of evidence from the Senate suggests that, while holding other factors constant, such as incumbency advantages and regional differences, the discrepancy in popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states hosting a Senate election is actually an increasing function of the onerous federal tax burden per state -LRB- with a progressive tax rate impacting higher-income states more severely -RRB-.",MUTATED,23
Modifier mutation,,"Put more simply, GOP candidates for president are generally looked on more favorably by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate, especially when the prisoner's dilemma is more severe.",MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,"Moreover, ticket splitting appears to consistently take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level, similar to that at the federal level.",MUTATED,9
Modifier mutation,,State government is typically more split along Republican-governor / Democratic-legislature lines than in the reverse scenario.,MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,"A comprehensive cross-state econometric investigation reveals that, when holding all other factors constant, the significant difference between a state's major-party vote for the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share in the lower state house serves as a positive function of the state tax rate.",MUTATED,15
Modifier mutation,,"In sum, at both the federal and state government levels, a significant portion of the behavior that voters display in the voting booth, which appears irrational, may actually have a surprisingly rational explanation.",MUTATED,12

Modifier mutation,,"Sport inherently involves fraud, as addressed by law",MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,Tricks such as those cleverly executed by Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax demonstrate wittiness but not the genuine will to remove a sanction.,MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,"The presumably deliberate expulsion by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in their game against Ajax on the 23rd of November in the European Champions League has sparked extensive debate, with rivers of ink being spilled over whether such behavior is truly unsportsmanlike and if both players deserve UEFA sanctions.",MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,"As we all know, just a few minutes before the end of the game (which their team had already secured), both players intentionally wasted time, prompting the referee to issue a second yellow card to each of them.",MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,"This way, and since Real Madrid is likely to emerge as the leader of its group, both players will presumably fulfil the prescribed sanction in the subsequent league game against Auxerre, thus being able to avoid the cards in the following phase.",MUTATED,9
Modifier mutation,,"Finally, the committee of discipline of the UEFA has strictly sanctioned the trainer of the team, Jose Mourinho, with a two-game ban and various economic amounts for the implicated players.",MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,"The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances similar to this one is not an uncommon practice, but rather a frequent occurrence in the world of football.",MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,"It is so thoroughly extended that it becomes an integral part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, yet is strictly followed by this sport.",MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,"Part of the intense debate arising in the related case is due to the fact that the team of the Real Madrid organization, which boasts of nobility and honor in its hymn, has penalized its players for similar acts, and to the dramatization seemingly orchestrated by Mourinho, who adds another chapter to his extensive history as a histrionic and provocative technician.",MUTATED,13
Modifier mutation,,"Anyway, the ongoing debate concerns whether that type of behavior, not explicitly prohibited by the regulation, fundamentally contradicts the principles of the sport; in other words, if these actions potentially constitute fraud. Then, indeed, they appear to comply with the sport's regulation, yet they seem to evade its spirit.",MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,The matter closely examines the type of damage that is severely brought to the sporting spirit.,MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,"One of the key advantages that embody the sporting spirit is the maintained physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that wasn't remotely endangered by their actions, meaning there was no trace of a violent game.",MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,"Another significant advantage alluded to with fare-play is to ensure that the team of lawbreaker players does not unfairly take advantage of the opposing team, which fortunately did not occur.",MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,"However, the paradoxical thing about the players of Real Madrid's action is that it did not conform to what we typically deem as mere legal manipulation; the violation of the rules was not committed discreetly in an attempt to evade sanctions, but rather their action was flagrantly obvious, resulting in punishment from the referee.",MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,They patiently waited for and accepted the sanction without any complaints.,MUTATED,2
Modifier mutation,,Another significant question is what type of advantage the violators actually obtained in the actions deliberately carried out.,MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,"Here it is crucial to note that it isn't necessarily a disadvantageous situation for the rival nor a guaranteed benefit in the same game, since ostensibly the result of the action implies leaving their own team with fewer players.",MUTATED,7
Modifier mutation,,"And it is certainly not a useful strategy for the upcoming game, because the club will barely be able to count on those players.",MUTATED,4
Modifier mutation,,The obvious advantage lies in the fact that the players will start the subsequent phase of the Championship without any cards that might jeopardize their participation in a future game.,MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,"But it is about a potentially long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team might be eliminated first in a change, and in addition, with this action, the players reluctantly fulfill a sanction game, advancing to the second cycle of cards, where the suspension due to card accumulation occurs less frequently than in the first cycle.",MUTATED,14
Modifier mutation,,"So that, by passing each round smoothly, it becomes increasingly clear that it is a significant advantage.",MUTATED,2
Modifier mutation,,"Those actions are fundamentally against the sporting spirit, which is an integral part of the strategic decisions that actively favor the advantages permitted by the rules.",MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,"Regarding this assumption, the players did not hastily act in order to avoid the application of the sanction (this would have been a clear case of legal fraud), but rather strategically chose when to obey it.",MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,They made a carefully strategic decision without avoiding the eventual punishment.,MUTATED,2
Modifier mutation,,"Although the border between the wittiness and the law fraud is somewhat diffuse, on this particular occasion, I believe it was an undoubtedly clear case of wittiness.",MUTATED,6
Modifier mutation,,"The controversy seems primarily to arise from two key factors: due to its relation to two auto expulsions and the manner in which the transmission of the directive was executed, leading to them.",MUTATED,5

Modifier mutation,,"Primarily, what is Cerenia used for?",MUTATED,1
Modifier mutation,,"Cerenia is an effective anti-emetic, which means it effectively stops vomiting.",MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,"It is commonly used in dogs to prevent vomiting, including that caused by chemotherapy medicines, which are used for the treatment of cancer and are known to provoke vomiting.",MUTATED,10
Modifier mutation,,"In combination with other supportive veterinary measures and a special diet, Cerenia is also effectively used in the treatment of vomiting, either as an injection or as an injection promptly followed by tablets.",MUTATED,13
Modifier mutation,,"For these specific purposes, Cerenia can be administered continuously for up to five days.",MUTATED,2
Modifier mutation,,How exactly does Cerenia work?,MUTATED,0
Modifier mutation,,"Cerenia effectively blocks a neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor, which acts centrally in the nervous system.",MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,How extensively has Cerenia been studied?,MUTATED,1
Modifier mutation,,A large number of studies with Cerenia were meticulously carried out either in laboratory dogs or in animal patients at various veterinary practices in several European countries and in the USA.,MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,What significant benefit has Cerenia consistently shown during the studies?,MUTATED,3
Modifier mutation,,"The results of the studies clearly showed that Cerenia was significantly more effective than the placebo, with substantially less vomiting seen in dogs that received the medicine compared to those that received a placebo, both for the treatment and prevention of vomiting.",MUTATED,12
Modifier mutation,,"The treatment for a severely vomiting dog should initially involve an injection, since animals in this condition might not be able to retain a tablet (as they could potentially vomit the intact tablet once more).",MUTATED,8
Modifier mutation,,"For follow-up treatment, the animal owner can carefully administer the tablets to the dog.",MUTATED,5
Modifier mutation,,"Also, the treatment of vomiting should solely be accompanied by other supportive measures or additional veterinary therapy when addressing the underlying causes of vomiting.",MUTATED,9
