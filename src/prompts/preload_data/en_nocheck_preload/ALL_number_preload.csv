Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Of numerous scenes that evoke rural England, this stands as one of the most lovely: An ancient stone church is nestled in the fields, the resonant bells pouring from its tower, summoning the devout to evensong.",MUTATED,11
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Several parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels frequently pause to converse at the church entrance, as the regulars here typically do.",MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"In the tower, a group of six men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same bells that first tolled here in 1614.",MUTATED,11
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"But there is also a single, modern note in Aslacton, though it can't be heard by the church-goers enjoying the sound of bells this cool autumn evening.",MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Similar to the majority of the remaining 5,000 churches across Britain equipped with bell sets, St. Michael previously possessed its unique group of ringers, signaling the start of every Sunday's morning and evening services.",MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Now, merely a single local ringer is left: the 64-year-old Derek Hammond.",MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Many of those here today reside elsewhere.,MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,They are part of a team of a dozen ringers -- including a couple of octogenarians and several young trainees -- who commute every weekend from church to church in a occasionally-tiring endeavor to maintain the bells' peals across the numerous belfries of East Anglia.,MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"To ring for just two services at this tower, we have to scrape, says Mr. Hammond, a retired water-authority worker.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"We've attempted to instruct the young people, yet they have their parties and their dances, and they simply wander off.",MUTATED,1
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Mr. Hammond worries that the passage of time and the impulsiveness of young adulthood may reduce the number of members in the East Anglian group that maintains the Aslacton bells tolling.,MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"After all, history is not merely on his side.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"According to a nationwide survey conducted a year ago, almost half of England's church bells are no longer rung on Sundays due to a lack of bell ringers.",MUTATED,11
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,It's straightforward to understand why this traditional art is hanging by a thread.,MUTATED,1
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The simpler version of playing tunes on bells, as with the carillons across continental Europe, is considered by the English to be immature, suitable merely for outsiders.",MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Change-ringing, a mind-boggling exercise the English invented centuries ago, requires physical dexterity -- a few bells weigh nearly two tons -- combined with intense mental concentration.",MUTATED,15
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Proper English bells are started off in 'rounds,' beginning with the highest-pitched bell and ending with the lowest - a simple descending scale using, in larger churches, up to 20 bells.",MUTATED,10
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Then, upon a given signal, the group of ringers start to modify the sequence of the bells' sounds without changing the consistent pace of the strikes.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Every modification, or alteration, can happen just once; that's what the rules indicate.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Ringers commit to memory various patterns of changes, referred to as 'methods,' with peculiar names such as Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Doubles.",MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"A series of approximately 3,000 changes constitutes a `` peal `` and takes around two hours.",MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,A glimpse of the Thursday evening rehearsal at St. Mary Abbot church in the Kensington area of London offers a sense of the tasks at hand.,MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Several shirt-sleeved ringers stand in a circle, each with a foot ahead of the next in a prize-fighter's stance, pulling on ropes that vanish through a series of small holes in the towering ceiling of the ringing chamber.",MUTATED,13
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"No one speaks, and the snaking of the ropes seems to create as little sound as the bells themselves, muffled by the ceiling.",MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Completely absorbed, the ringers gaze fixedly ahead, using their peripheral vision (which they term 'rope-awareness') to monitor the surrounding ropes and accordingly synchronize their pulls.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Far above in the belfry, the large bronze bells, mounted on wheels, swing wildly through nearly a full circle, beginning and concluding, surprisingly, in the inverted, or mouth-up position.",MUTATED,10
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Skilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard each subsequent swing, allowing a pair of bells to swap places during the subsequent change.",MUTATED,11
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"In a renowned detective-story involving the peal of church bells, the English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers portrayed ringing as a 'passion that seeks its gratification in the pursuit of mathematical precision and mechanical excellence.'",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Ringers, she continued, are 'imbued with the profound inebriation that arises from complex rituals executed without fault.'",MUTATED,1
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Ringing does become quite an obsession, `` admits Stephanie Pattenden, the master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of the top female ringers in England.",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"It is a passion that often remains within the tower, however.",MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Frequently, bell ringers view the church as an appendage fixed beneath the bell tower.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"When their changes are done, and after they've worked up some sweat, several ringers frequently head to the nearby pub, leaving the worship for the remaining crowd below.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,This does not sit well with a few clerics.,MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"With the membership of the Church of England gradually declining, a determined few vicars are urging as many non-religious ringers as possible to attend services.",MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Several years ago, the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone, vicar of Great Torrington, Devon, got so fed up with a few ringers who did not attend service he sacked the entire band; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest.",MUTATED,13
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"They were an enduring club that regarded the tower as a kind of distinct premises, the Vicar Hummerstone notes.",MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"A completely new band performs today at Great Torrington, a couple of which are part of the congregation.",MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,But there still are not enough ringers to ring more than five of the seven bells.,MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"At St. Mary's Church in Ilminster, Somerset, several bells have fallen silent after a dispute concerning the church's attendance numbers.",MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The vicar, W.D. Jones, refuses to discuss the matter, claiming it would once again 'open the wound.'",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"But C.J.B. Marshall, vicar of the sole church nearby, feels the fault lies with the several stairs from the bell tower that are positioned adjacent to the altar.",MUTATED,7
,,,DUMP,
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Vicar Marshall acknowledges having conflicting feelings regarding this matter, as he is not only a vicar but also a diligent bell-ringer.",MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The peal of bells serves as a lure to attract the faithful to the church, he asserts.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,I live with the hope that those ringers will be drawn into a more fulfilling life.,MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, a type of parliament for numerous ringing groups, seeks to enhance relations with vicars, notes John C. Baldwin, the president.",MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"It hopes to address several students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for each vicar across the country entitled, 'The Bells in Your Care.'",MUTATED,13
,,,DUMP,
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Mr. Baldwin is also tackling the bigger issue: shortage of ringers.,MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"A recent poll indicates that among the approximately 80,000 skilled bellringers in England currently, merely 30,000 continue to chime.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Also, ringers are not frequently located in the areas where bells are required to be tolled -- such as in several small, rural parishes or inner-city congregations.",MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"But the council's program to attract and train several ringers is only somewhat successful, says Mr. Baldwin.",MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Right now, we're fortunate if after three years we retain even two new ringers out of 15, he adds.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,A promising indicator is the increasing amount of women who have broken into the traditionally male field; over half of the ringers currently are female.,MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"They are accepted almost everywhere, however.",MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The oldest bell-ringing group in the country, the Ancient Society of College Youths, established in the 17th century, continues to be male-only, a fact that's especially frustrating to women since the group is the primary source of ringers for some of Britain's most esteemed churches, including St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey.",MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"This being Britain, not a single woman has filed an equal-opportunity suit, yet the depth of the problem became apparent this summer through a collection of letters in 'The Ringing World,' a weekly publication read by many ringers.",MUTATED,10
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Several writers, signing their letters as 'Red-blooded, balanced males,' commented on the 'frequent occurrence of women fainting in groups,' and proposed that they 'revert to their traditional role of preparing tea during gatherings.'",MUTATED,10
,,,DUMP,
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Another woman wrote from Sheffield to say that in her eighty years of ringing, 'I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry.'",MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"I have seen a few men die, bless them.",MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Medical scientists are beginning to reveal several genes which, if impaired, trigger the uncontrolled growth of cells that defines cancer.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Scientists say the discovery of these genes in the past few months is painting a fresh and surprising picture of how cancer develops.,MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,An evolving comprehension of multiple genes is anticipated to yield a variety of innovative strategies for the advancement of cancer treatment and prevention in the coming years.,MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,That is for the distant future.,MUTATED,1
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Already, scientists are creating tests based on the recently discovered genes which, for the second time, may indicate if an otherwise healthy person is prone to developing cancer.",MUTATED,10
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"It's an exciting set of discoveries, says Bert Vogelstein, a Johns Hopkins University researcher who has recently identified a gene crucial for the onset of colon cancer.",MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Just over a decade ago, cancer was a mystery about which we knew very little at the molecular level.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Today, we know that the build-up of a few of these mutated genes may start a cancer and, subsequently, drive it towards a fatal state.",MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Scientists refer to the new class of genes as tumor-suppressing, or more simply, anti-cancer genes.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"When functioning properly, they produce proteins that regulate a cell's growth.",MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"But if multiple genes are damaged -- perhaps due to radiation, a chemical, or a random accident during cell division -- their growth-suppressing proteins no longer function properly, and cells that would typically remain benign can turn cancerous.",MUTATED,10
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The newly identified genes differ from a group of genes discovered in the late 1970s known as oncogenes.,MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Oncogenes are required for a cell to transform into a malignant state, yet researchers have identified them in both several normal and numerous cancerous cells, indicating that oncogenes alone may not be the sole cause of cancer.",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"In the past few months, researchers have come to believe that several types of cancer genes work in concert: An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only once the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged.",MUTATED,15
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"As with most genes, tumor-suppressor genes are passed down in a pair, with each parent contributing one.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Any of the duplicates can produce the proteins required to regulate cell growth, thus cancer emerges only when all duplicates are compromised.",MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"A person who is born with two defective copies of a suppressor gene, or in whom both copies are damaged early in life, is especially prone to cancer because they need only lose one other copy for cancer to develop.",MUTATED,14
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Several upcoming genetic tests may potentially identify these cancer-prone individuals, heralding what a few scientists consider to be a novel era of predictive cancer diagnosis.",MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Bill and Bonnie Quinlan are among several initial beneficiaries of the new findings.,MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The Dedham, Mass. couple knew even before Bonnie became pregnant in 1987 that any child of theirs had a high chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma, an eye cancer that occurs roughly once in every 25,000 births.",MUTATED,15
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Mr. Quinlan, at the age of 30, knew he carried a defective gene, having lost an eye to the uncommon tumor at just three months old -- following in the footsteps of his mother who had endured the identical fate as an infant.",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Due to the isolation of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, it became feasible last February to determine the threat the Quinlan baby was facing.",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"A test using new `` genetic probes `` showed that little Will Quinlan had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene and, therefore, faced slightly less risk than most other children of developing the rare cancer.",MUTATED,16
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"It made our holiday season, says Mr. Quinlan.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,This initial test could reliably predict if a person was likely to develop cancer.,MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Equally significant, the pioneering finding of the gene responsible for controlling retinal cell development, made by a Boston-based physician, Thaddeus Dryja, has launched a new realm in cancer research, which over the past few months has seen an exponential surge.",MUTATED,8
,,,DUMP,
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Some of this may not be obvious to the public, which is eager for advances in treatment, but I am convinced this fundamental research will start showing progress there shortly.",MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"To date, scientists have identified several of these cancer-suppressors.",MUTATED,1
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Dr. Dryja made his retinoblastoma discovery in the late 1980s.,MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Then last spring, researchers reported the discovery of a single gene, named p53, which, when defective, can transform healthy colon cells into cancerous ones.",MUTATED,10
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Shortly after that report, several additional research teams discovered evidence indicating that the identical mutated p53 gene is present in tissue samples from both lung and breast cancers.",MUTATED,10
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Colon, lung and breast cancers are among the most prevalent and deadliest forms of the disease, jointly taking the lives of nearly 150,000 Americans annually.",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Currently, nearly twenty laboratories in the U.S., Canada, and Britain are in a hurry to identify additional potential tumor-suppressing genes.",MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,They have approximately eight candidates.,MUTATED,0
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Researchers suggest that the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes, either by themselves or through a mix, seems essential for the onset of various cancers including those of the brain, skin, kidneys, prostate, and cervix.",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"There is evidence suggesting that when individuals inherit flawed copies of such genes, they are particularly susceptible to cancer, which might account for why certain forms of cancer appear to persist in a few families.",MUTATED,6
,,,DUMP,
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"He theorized that in eye cancer, an infant may inherit a single damaged gene copy from one parent and a healthy copy from the other.",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The tumor, he suggested, emerged when the additional, normal copy was also damaged.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,But there was no method to validate Dr. Knudson's `` multi-hit `` hypothesis.,MUTATED,0
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Back then, scientists had no method to isolate particular genes, yet with the aid of a microscope they could visualize several pairs of chromosomes within the cells that harbor the genes.",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Sometimes, significant chromosome damage was observable.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Dr. Knudson discovered that a few children affected by the eye cancer had inherited a faulty copy of chromosome No. 17 from a parent suffering from the disease.,MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Under a microscope he could actually see that a piece of chromosome 7 was missing.,MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,He assumed the missing pieces contained a gene or several genes whose loss played a critical role in triggering the cancer.,MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,But he did not know which gene or several genes had vanished.,MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Then, the scientific team, led by the renowned molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee, located the answer.",MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The team utilized several of the newly developed gene probes, snippets of genetic material capable of monitoring a gene's presence within a cell.",MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"By analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors, they identified defects in the sole copy of chromosome 13 in the precise region corresponding to the initial copy of the chromosome.",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The discovery captivated the medical field.,MUTATED,0
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,It was the initial instance someone demonstrated that the absence of a single copy of the identical gene could result in the onset of cancer.,MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"It was extraordinarily satisfying, Dr. Knudson notes, currently at the Fox Chase Cancer Research Center in Philadelphia.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,I was convinced that what was true of retinoblastoma would be true for most cancers.,MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,It was one audacious claim.,MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"But in Baltimore, Dr. Vogelstein, a young molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School, believed Dr. Knudson was correct, and embarked on repeating the Cavenee experiment in several cells from various cancers.",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"His was one of several research teams in the 1980s to report dual chromosome losses in a rare form of childhood cancer affecting the kidney, known as Wilm's tumor.",MUTATED,11
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Dr. Vogelstein next shifted his focus to colon cancer, one of the primary cancer killers in the U.S., ranking just after lung cancer.",MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"He believed colon cancer could arise from several 'hits' on cancer suppressor genes, as it frequently appears to develop in a series of stages.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"It frequently is preceded by the development of several polyps in the bowel, which in multiple cases become increasingly malignant in distinguishable stages -- progressing from mild to fatal -- as if a series of genetic damage might be occurring.",MUTATED,13
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Dr. Vogelstein and a doctoral student, Eric Fearon, embarked on several months of meticulous and frequently disheartening examination of the chromosomes in search of evidence of genetic damage.",MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"They began uncovering a complex array of genetic deletions, some found exclusively in non-cancerous polyps, others solely in cancerous cells, and numerous in both types of polyps and cancerous cells.",MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Eventually, a clear image of the progression of cancer emerged.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"If either copy of a certain gene were knocked out, benign polyps could develop.",MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"If all copies of a specific gene were subsequently deleted, the polyps could progress towards malignancy.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,It was clear that several genes needed to be damaged for colon cancer to develop.,MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The report galvanized several other molecular biologists.,MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"It was the confirming evidence we needed that several gene losses were critical to the development of various common tumors, says Ray White at Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Salt Lake City.",MUTATED,10
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"But Dr. Vogelstein had not yet pinpointed the identity of the gene which, upon damage, could transform a colon cell into a full-blown malignancy.",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,They concentrated on chromosome number 18.,MUTATED,1
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"For several months, the Johns Hopkins researchers, using gene probes, experimentally traversed the length of chromosome 17, searching for the tiniest shared segment of genetic material missing in every tumor cell.",MUTATED,11
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Such this piece of DNA could potentially constitute a gene.,MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"When they discovered it the previous winter, Dr. Vogelstein doubted that the search had truly concluded.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"His doubts stemmed from the fact that a few years prior a Princeton University researcher, Arnold Levine, had discovered in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could convert normal cells into cancerous ones.",MUTATED,13
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The deletion Dr. Vogelstein discovered was in the identical location as p53.,MUTATED,0
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"But Mr. Levine had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting the expansion, whereas the Johns Hopkins researchers were searching for a gene that inhibited growth.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Despite that, when the Johns Hopkins scientists compared the genes they had found in human cancer cells with Mr. Levine's p53 gene, they discovered the single gene to be identical; it turned out that in Mr. Levine's cancer research, he had inadvertently been studying a mutated form of p53 -- a gene that suppresses cancer.",MUTATED,10
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The discovery suddenly puts a single obscure gene at the heart of cancer formation, says Robert Weinberg, a prominent leader in cancer-gene research at Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass.",MUTATED,10
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Evidence is increasingly emerging that the p53 suppressor gene is involved in several other cancers as well.,MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Researchers in Edinburgh, Scotland, have discovered that in approximately half of the breast tumors sampled, a single copy of chromosome 17 exhibited a mutation in the region of the p53 gene.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The scientists say that breast cancer frequently affects several members in some families, indicating that the gene, when inherited in a defective form, may increase the risk of cancer in women.",MUTATED,10
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The p53 gene has recently been implicated in the development of lung cancer.,MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"In a report released last week, John Minna and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute found that approximately two-thirds of the cells extracted from lung cancer tissue they analyzed lack this gene.",MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"There are numerous reports from various labs, as yet unpublished, concerning missing p53 genes in tissue sampled from kidney, brain, and skin cancers.",MUTATED,11
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Concurrently, multiple teams including Johns Hopkins are hastening to identify additional tumor-suppressor genes.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Dr. Vogelstein hopes to soon isolate several on chromosome 18, also involved in colon cancer.",MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Ray White in Utah and Walter Bodmer, a researcher in Great Britain, are close to finding a gene involved with several types of colon cancer, thought to be located on chromosome 7.",MUTATED,10
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Dr. Minna believes individuals who inherit a defective gene on any of their multiple copies of chromosome 3 are especially susceptible to lung cancer.,MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Recently, he and others reported that the retinoblastoma suppressor gene may also be involved in a few lung cancers, as well as several additional common cancers, too.",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Where these findings will ultimately lead, researchers can merely conjecture.",MUTATED,1
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Already several leading pharmaceutical companies, including the Squibb division of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., are working together with gene hunters to transform the expected flood of discoveries into predictive tests and, potentially, innovative therapies.",MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,A few researchers suggest that novel cancer medications capable of slowing or reversing tumor growth might be derived from the suppressor proteins typically generated by genes.,MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The concept involves administering growth-controlling proteins, produced by multiple healthy versions of the affected genes, to several patients.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"It might potentially be feasible to swap out a few defective genes for healthy alternatives, yet no one has managed to accomplish this to date.",MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"In any scenario, Dr. Minna from the National Cancer Institute asserts, 'We're observing the uncovering of one of the crucial steps in the origin of cancer.'",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Why can't we teach a few children to read, write, and calculate?",MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"It's not that we don't sometimes know how to, because we often do.",MUTATED,1
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,It's not that we want to.,MUTATED,1
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"And the reason we do not wish to is that truly effective education might demand we放弃 several deeply held metaphysical beliefs regarding human nature, both broadly and specifically in the case of youth, as well as to challenge a handful of cherished vested interests.",MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"These beliefs so thoroughly dominate our educational establishment, our media, our politicians, and even our parents that it appears nearly blasphemous to challenge them.",MUTATED,10
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Here are several examples.,MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"If I were to ask several American parents, `` Do you wish the elementary schools to encourage creativity in your children? `` the overwhelming response would be, `` Yes, without a doubt. ``",MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,But what do we exactly mean by `` creativity ``?,MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Not a single person is able to assert.,MUTATED,0
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"In practice, it often ends up being equated with a form of 'self-expression' that fosters the self-esteem of many youngsters.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The outcome is an era of youth whose ignorance and intellectual inadequacy is equaled only by their high opinion of themselves.,MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The entire concept of 'creativity' in education has been a key aspect of a romantic defiance against strict instruction, seen as 'authoritarian,' suppressing the hidden talents and the remarkable, still untapped, potentialities within the spirit of every single child.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,It is not surprising that some parents find this level of romantic extravagance incredibly attractive.,MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Fortunately, these identical parents do desire their children to receive a proper education as has been traditionally recognized, and they possess the requisite common sense to understand the demands of such an endeavor.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Their commitment to creativity will not withstand the illiteracy of most adolescents.,MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The trajectory of American education's future will be shaped by the extent to which each of us permits this common sense to triumph above the illusions we collectively hold.,MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The education establishment will fight against common sense every step of the way.,MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The reasons are complex, but a few simple reasons ought not to be underestimated.",MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Progressive education (as it was once termed) is much more interesting and agreeable to teachers than disciplined instruction.,MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,It is pleasant for educators to believe they contribute to 'personality development' and even more pleasing to reduce the numerous irritating tests that frequently yield unsatisfactory results.,MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"It also provides teachers with an enhanced self-definition as a `` profession , `` considering they have completed courses in educational psychology and philosophy of education .",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"I myself took several courses in college, thinking I might end up a schoolteacher.",MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Most of them could fairly be described as 'pap' courses.,MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"But it's not fair to solely blame teachers, as opposed to the entire educational establishment.",MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"I know a few schoolteachers and, on the whole, they are deeply dedicated to thorough teaching.",MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"They may not be among the top and brightest of their generation -- there are exceedingly few such individuals, by definition.",MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,But they need not necessarily do their jobs effectively.,MUTATED,1
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Yes, we all can recall a few truly inspiring teachers from our school days.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"But our education was handled by several others, who were just adequately competent and thoroughly conscientious.",MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"In this sense, a teacher can be likened to a handful of family doctors.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"If he were truly exceptional, he likely would not have become a family doctor to begin with.",MUTATED,0
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"If he is either competent or conscientious, he serves us admirably.",MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Our teachers are a crucial element in our ongoing educational crisis.,MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Whether they are underpaid or not is an issue of equity; it's not merely an educational challenge.,MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,It is silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got several thousand dollars more per annum.,MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"It is the sort of libel that teachers' unions frequently do not object to spreading, for their own limited aims.",MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"It is also a sort of libel that numerous politicians find beneficial, as it assists them in maintaining a friendly demeanor on behalf of a crucial group of constituents.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"But there isn't a single piece of evidence that, all else being equal, wage differentials lead to educational disparities.",MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"If there were any evidence, you can be sure you would have heard about it.",MUTATED,2

Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"We know that early exposure to schooling enhances performance in the initial grade, yet the advantage is swiftly diminished later on.",MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Let's summarize what we generally know about education and the various education reforms that can work or fail: -- 'Parental involvement' is often a poor concept.,MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Parents are far too likely to attribute the educational limitations of their children to schools.,MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Parents should be actively involved in their children's education at home, as opposed to solely at school.",MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,They should ensure their kids do not frequently play truant; they should make sure that the children allocate sufficient time to homework; they should review the report card.,MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"If parents are dissatisfied with their child's school, they should possess the option to switch to a different one.",MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Community involvement is a much worse idea.,MUTATED,4

Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The severe hangover reminded him once again of his peculiar conversation with that weirdy, and he groaned loudly.",MUTATED,5

Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Tuesday's rout of a GOP congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district that hasn't backed a Democratic presidential candidate since the 1950s is a further reminder that, at the federal level, political 'ticket splitting' has been increasing over the past few decades.",MUTATED,13
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"In just a single presidential election year before 1948, over 25 % of the nation's congressional districts selected a candidate from another party for the White House不同于the House of Representatives.",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Now that percentage often amounts to a quarter and has exceeded 35% twice.,MUTATED,1
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"As we know, voters tend to favor Republicans to a greater extent in presidential races than in congressional ones.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"In each presidential election during the past fifty years, with the exception of the Goldwater candidacy, the GOP has obtained a higher share of the major-party popular vote for president than it has for congressional seats or the vote for Congressional representatives.",MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Almost until the mid-1930s, the pattern was virtually reversed.",MUTATED,1
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,What accounts for the outcomes of the past few decades?,MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,A simple economic theory might offer more than a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by Americans in the voting booth.,MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The theory is based on several assumptions:,MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Voters can 'buy' one of several brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the limited state and in the benefits of private markets versus the drawbacks of public action, and a Democratic brand that advocates for strong government and public interference to correct the extremes resulting from the pursuit of personal interest.",MUTATED,16
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Congressional representatives have several fundamental tasks during their time in office -- addressing national concerns (including programmatic actions like casting votes on legislation that imposes expenses and/or provides advantages to the general public) and focusing on local matters (such as constituency service and earmarked projects).,MUTATED,11
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Several Republican congressional representatives, due to their belief in a limited government, are less inclined to pursue local benefits than their Democratic counterparts in Congress.",MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"If those assumptions hold, voters in several Congressional races face what, in economic theory, is known as a prisoner's dilemma and possess an incentive, on the edge, to lean towards the Democrats.",MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"If they install a single Republican in office, not only will they secure fewer local benefits, but their chosen legislator will be somewhat powerless to stop multiple legislators from 'bringing home the bacon' to their respective constituencies.",MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Each legislator, after all, is merely one of hundreds when it comes to national policy making.",MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"In many races for the White House, a voter's incentive, even at the slightest margin, is to favor the Republicans.",MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Although a GOP president might limit some local benefits to a voter's specific district/state, such a president is also likely to be more effective in stopping numerous other districts/states and their legislators from securing local benefits.",MUTATED,10
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The standing of each voter may potentially be improved with reduced taxes.,MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"While this theory is very simple, it seems to account for a number of things.",MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"First, why ticket splitting has multiplied and assumed the odd pattern that it has throughout the past century: Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the onset of the New Deal, government played a far less significant role in society and the prisoner's dilemma issue facing voters in congressional races was notably less intense.",MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Second, it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain yet often cherish their own congressional representatives: Each individual legislator's constituents value the particular benefits that the legislator secures for them, but disregard the collective cost that comes with every additional legislator doing the same for their respective constituencies.",MUTATED,14
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The theory suggests that legislators who focus excessively on national policy over local benefit pursuits tend to have less security in their offices.,MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"For example, several first-term members of the House, once among the most vulnerable incumbents, have nearly become immune to defeat.",MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The sole exception to this recent trend was the defeat of several of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982.,MUTATED,11
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Because these freshmen placed significant emphasis on their partisan role -- spreading the Reagan revolution -- in national policy making, they were highly vulnerable to defeat.",MUTATED,10
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The theory indicates why the Republican Party might frequently face challenges in attracting viable candidates for congressional office.,MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Several potential candidates might be deterred from running not so much by the meager congressional salary as by the likelihood of losing to a single Democratic opponent.,MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"To some extent, if potential Republican candidates and their financial supporters recognize that the congressional prisoner's dilemma game often works against them, the Republican Party may face obstacles in its efforts to present a competitive group of congressional candidates.",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Firstly, the theory may offer at most a partial reason for the pronounced ticket splitting in the South.",MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"To the extent that Southern Democratic legislators have maintained an unequal share of power in Congress since the early 20th century and could convert this influence into numerous local advantages for their constituencies, the electorate in the South possess a particularly compelling reason to retain these Democrats in their positions.",MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Ultimately, the theory suggests why Republicans often fare better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Since local benefit-seeking matters somewhat more and national policy making matters somewhat less in the lower chamber of Congress, this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are somewhat less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts.",MUTATED,12
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Are there several empirical supports for this theory?,MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Several pieces of evidence support the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more inclined to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican counterparts.,MUTATED,10
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo discover that GOP senators return approximately 15% more of their designated personal staff budgets compared to what Democrats allocate.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"To some degree, when the main responsibility of personal staff partly includes seeking local benefits, this suggests that the political philosophy causes congressional Republicans to allocate fewer resources to specific constituent issues.",MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Second, if the core assumption holds true, Democrats typically exhibit lower attendance in roll-call votes than Republicans, particularly when these votes significantly mirror national policy decisions, and to an extent that engaging in them diverts time that legislators might allocate to local advantage pursuits.",MUTATED,13
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"This is indeed what the data consistently indicate, especially in the case of the Congressional House.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The Democratic House attendance rate has not surpassed the Republican House attendance rate in over sixty years.,MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Ultimately, as indicated in the table, Democrats assign a greater portion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking tasks are prioritized over national policy-making activities compared to Washington offices.",MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"An examination of alterations in personal staffing decisions in the Senate from 1985 to 1988 -LRB- a period where the controlling party shifted -RRB- , moreover , shows that the staffing differences listed in the table cannot be solely attributed to the significant influence Democrats hold , because of their status as the majority party , over additional resources including committee staff .",MUTATED,13
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"An extra piece of evidence from the Senate suggests: Keeping all other factors consistent, including incumbency benefits and regional differences, the discrepancy in popular votes for Republican presidential versus senatorial candidates in states hosting a Senate election appears to be an inverse function of the federal government's burdensome tax load per state -LRB- a progressive tax system impacts higher-income states more significantly -RRB-.",MUTATED,17
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Put somewhat simply, GOP candidates for president are viewed more favorably by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner's dilemma is particularly severe.",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Moreover, ticket splitting seems to follow a similar peculiar trend at the state government level as it does at the federal level.",MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"State governments are frequently divided along Republican-governor / Democratic-legislature lines, more often than not.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"A cross-state econometric investigation, moreover, indicates that, keeping all other factors consistent, the discrepancy between a state's majority-party vote for the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republicans' portion of the state's lower legislative house is an increasing function with respect to the state tax percentage.",MUTATED,10
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"In total, at the federal and state government levels, a significant portion of the seemingly irrational behavior voters exhibit in the voting booth might actually have a perfectly rational explanation.",MUTATED,10

Numerical Quantifier mutation,,But lawyers for Mr. Hayes have already submitted legal documents to the court that outline appeal arguments which could engage the courts for several years.,MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Some of the most provocative aspects include the extensive reporting on the trial - with numerous reporters' heavy reliance on Twitter - generating a 'circus atmosphere' and such pervasive, immediate exposure to inflammatory details that the jury might have been unduly influenced by public passions.",MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The claim might prompt appeals judges to confront the issue of whether advancing technologies necessitate revised courtroom rules.,MUTATED,5
,,,DUMP,
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The trial judge, Jon C. Blue of State Superior Court, succinctly dismissed the allegations in a decision the previous week, noting that the news media were 'strictly monitored' and that there was no indication the jury was influenced by passion.",MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,But that is not likely to be the final word on the issue.,MUTATED,1
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"For many years, appellate courts have acknowledged that extensive coverage of high-profile cases may prompt doubts about a trial's fairness.",MUTATED,4

Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The crime is thought to have inspired several television shows and a movie, including `` The Fugitive. ``",MUTATED,2

Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"A few jurors have stated that they were disgusted by the images of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, in her late forties, and her children, Hayley, a teenager, and Michaela, a pre-teen.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The defense lawyers claim they intend to dispute the legality of the death penalty and assert that the judge incorrectly dismissed a juror who was skeptical of the prosecutors and that he inappropriately increased the urgency for a decision by his unexpected move to instruct the jury to deliberate throughout the weekend.,MUTATED,6

Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Tricks akin to the ones by Alonso and Ramos prior to the Ajax match showcase wittiness yet lack the determination to revoke a sanction.,MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The expulsion presumably caused by several players of Real Madrid in the game played on the 23rd of November against Ajax in the European Champions League has led to rivers of ink being written about whether such behavior is unsportsmanlike and if both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.,MUTATED,5

Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances akin to these is not an uncommon practice, indeed it is quite frequent within the realm of football.",MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"It is such a fundamental aspect that it becomes part of the ethos, one of the unwritten rules, yet still adhered to by this sport.",MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"A significant portion of the debate stemming from the related case is due to the actions carried out by the Real Madrid organization's squad (which, in its hymn, boasts of nobility and honor, and has penalized its players for similar infractions) and the dramatization seemingly masterminded by Mourinho, who adds another chapter to his lengthy history of being a provocative and theatrical coach.",MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Anyway, the debate revolves around whether that sort of behavior, not explicitly forbidden by any regulation, conflicts with the fundamental principles of the sport; in other words, if such actions potentially constitute fraud. Then, indeed, they are compliant with the sport's regulations, yet they appear to defy its spirit.",MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The issue assesses various types of damage inflicted upon the sporting spirit.,MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Several of the advantages embodying the sporting spirit involve the physical integrity of the opposing players; this aspect was not compromised by their actions, meaning there was no instance of a violent game.",MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"One of these advantages alluded to with fair-play is to prevent the team of lawbreaking players from unfairly dominating the opposing team, which didn't occur this time.",MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"However, the paradoxical thing about the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not comply with what we typically characterize as a single legal fraud, because the violation of the rules was not conducted clandestinely to attempt to evade the sanction, but their action was quite evident and, as a result, they faced punishment from the referee.",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,They waited and accepted the sanction without a single complaint.,MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,A few questions remain about the type of advantage the violators gained from the actions they deliberately executed.,MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Here it seems necessary to state that it isn't a disadvantageous situation for either rival or a single benefit in the same game, because evidently the result of the action supposes leaving their own team with fewer players.",MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"And it's not a useful strategy for the upcoming game, as the club won't be able to rely on these players.",MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The advantage, clearly, lies in the reality that the players will enter the subsequent stage of the Championship free of cards that might jeopardize their involvement in any upcoming games.",MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"But it is about a long-term advantage, with a considerable degree of indetermination, because the team might be eliminated at the first instance of change, and furthermore, with this action, the players face a sanction game and proceed to the next cycle of cards, where the suspension due to card accumulation occurs with fewer instances than in the initial cycle.",MUTATED,13
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"So that, after several rounds, it's not entirely obvious that it's a significant advantage.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"These actions are truly opposed to the athletic spirit, a component of strategic decisions that support leveraging the benefits permitted by the regulations.",MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Regarding this assumption, the players did not act twice in order to avoid the application of the sanction (this would have been a clear case of legal fraud), but rather selected the right moment to comply with it.",MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,They made several strategic decisions without avoiding any punishment.,MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Although the boundary between wittiness and legal fraud can be vague, on this particular occasion, I contend it was an apparent instance of wittiness.",MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The controversy seems to stem from several factors: due to the multiple auto expulsions and the manner in which the directive's transmission was executed, leading to them.",MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The extensive harm caused to the core principles of the sport by these numerous actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.,MUTATED,3

Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Each national report contains a collection of over 20 initiatives which effectively showcase policies and practices aimed at enhancing the recruitment, training, and development of ageing workers within the workplace and community alike.",MUTATED,12
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"For each country, several initiatives have been chosen for more detailed case study.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"This case study analysed the background of several initiatives, their impact on various employment patterns and different work organisations, and assessed both the benefits and problems of each initiative.",MUTATED,11
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Several visits and a few interviews with key personnel were also conducted.,MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Several national studies will serve as the foundation for a comprehensive European report that synthesises prevalent practices.,MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The report and a casebook of initiatives will be published in 2000 and provide the backdrop for a conference to be staged in the Autumn of that year.,MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The Foundation strives to document the various characteristics of age barriers within job recruitment and training, as well as to examine the multiple causes.",MUTATED,9
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The perspectives of numerous social partners are also being examined, with specific attention focused on proposals to eliminate age barriers.",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Thirdly, the project documents and assesses numerous initiatives in both the public and private sectors that address age barriers, particularly affecting the elderly workforce.",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Seeking multiple alternatives to early retirement and redundancy, the project is primarily concerned with the retention, reintegration, and training of several older workers.",MUTATED,11
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The various gender and ethnic backgrounds of numerous workers and their correlation with age discrimination are thoroughly examined.,MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The project also considers multiple initiatives to combat age discrimination in various rural areas as well as in a few small enterprises.,MUTATED,8

Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Cerenia contains the active substance maropitant and is available in two forms: tablet or solution for injection.,MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,The tablets are pale-orange and have score lines on each side so they can be divided in half.,MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Every tablet is marked with the Pfizer logo on one side and the letters MPT along with the amount of maropitant on the opposite side.,MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,What are the multiple uses of Cerenia?,MUTATED,0
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Cerenia is one of the anti-emetics, this means that it prevents nausea and vomiting.",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"It is commonly used in canines to prevent episodes of vomiting, including those caused by chemotherapy drugs (some cancer treatment medications that are widely recognized to induce vomiting).",MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"In conjunction with various supportive measures like additional veterinary treatments or a unique diet, Cerenia may also be employed for treating vomiting (whether it's an injection alone or an injection preceding tablet intake).",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"For these purposes, Cerenia can be administered for as many as seven days",MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,What are the mechanisms by which Cerenia operates?,MUTATED,0
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Cerenia blocks several neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors, which act in the central nervous system.",MUTATED,3
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,How extensively has Cerenia been studied?,MUTATED,1
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Several studies with Cerenia were conducted in laboratory dogs or in animal patients at veterinary practices in a few European countries and in the USA.,MUTATED,5
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,What benefits have Cerenia demonstrated in numerous studies?,MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The results from multiple studies indicated that Cerenia was significantly more effective than a placebo, with a marked reduction in vomiting observed in dogs given the medication compared to those given the control, both for treating and preventing vomiting episodes.",MUTATED,6
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"The treatment for a vomiting dog should begin with an injection, because some animals might not retain a single tablet (as they could potentially regurgitate the whole tablet again).",MUTATED,7
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"For ongoing treatment, the pet owner may give the three tablets to the dog daily.",MUTATED,4
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,"Also, the treatment of vomiting should merely be accompanied by additional supportive measures or alternative veterinary therapies when addressing the underlying causes of the vomiting.",MUTATED,8
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,What are the risks associated with Cerenia?,MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Cerenia was generally well tolerated when administered daily at dosages up to 4 times the recommended doses for an extended period (up to 2 times the recommended maximum duration of treatment).,MUTATED,12
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,What are the necessary precautions for anyone administering the medication or interacting with the animal?,MUTATED,2
Numerical Quantifier mutation,,Cerenia does not pose a significant risk to individuals.,MUTATED,2
