Simple Past Tense,,Parents were too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children.,MUTATED,8
Simple Future Tense,,Parents will need to be involved in their children's education at home rather than at school.,MUTATED,5
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,They have seen to it that their kids do not play truant; they have made certain that the children have spent enough time doing homework; they have scrutinized the report card.,MUTATED,10

Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,"Before 1948, there has been only one presidential election year where more than 20% of the nation's congressional districts chose a different party's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives.",MUTATED,9
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,Now that percentage has routinely equaled a third and twice has been above 40 %.,MUTATED,2
Simple Past Tense,,Voters tended to favor Republicans in races for the presidency.,MUTATED,5
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,"In every presidential election over the past half century, except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy, the GOP has consistently captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has held in congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress.",MUTATED,11
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,"By 1932, the pattern had been nearly the opposite.",MUTATED,2
Simple Past Tense,,What accounted for the results of the past decades?,MUTATED,3
Simple Past Tense,,A simple economic theory provided at least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by Americans in the voting booth.,MUTATED,8
Simple Past Tense,,The theory relied on three assumptions.,MUTATED,2
Tense mutation,,"Voters are able to `` buy `` one of two brands as they select their political agents -- a Republican brand believing in the minimalist state and the virtues of private markets versus the vices of public action, and a Democratic brand advocating for big government and public intervention to rectify the excesses resulting from the pursuit of private interests.",MUTATED,22
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,Congressional representatives have had two basic responsibilities while voting in office -- dealing with national issues (programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that has imposed costs and/or conferred benefits on the population at large) and attending to local issues (constituency service and pork barrel).,MUTATED,19
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,"3 -RRB- Republican congressional representatives, because of their belief in a minimalist state, have been less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than have Democratic members of Congress.",MUTATED,9
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,"If these assumptions have held, voters in races for Congress have faced what in economic theory is called a prisoner's dilemma and have had an incentive, at the margin, to lean Democratic.",MUTATED,10
Simple Past Tense to Past Perfect Tense,,"If they had put a Republican into office, not only would they have acquired less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator would have been relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from 'bringing home the bacon' to their respective constituencies.",MUTATED,11
Simple Past Tense,,"Each legislator, after all, was only one out of 535 when it came to national policy making.",MUTATED,5
Simple Past Tense,,"In races for the White House, a voter's incentive, at the margin, was to lean Republican.",MUTATED,4
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,"Although a GOP president has limited local benefits to the voter's particular district/state, such a president is also likely to have been more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits.",MUTATED,11
Simple Future to Present Perfect Tense,,The individual voter's standing has been enhanced through lower taxes.,MUTATED,5
Present Perfect Tense,,"This theory has appeared to explain several things, despite being exceedingly simple.",MUTATED,6
Simple Future Tense,,"First, why ticket splitting will increase and continue to take the peculiar pattern it has been developing over the past half century: Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal, government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner's dilemma problem that will confront voters in races for Congress is expected to be considerably less severe.",MUTATED,17
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,"Second, it explains why voters have held Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives: Any individual legislator's constituents have appreciated the specific benefits that the legislator has won for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator having done likewise for his own constituency.",MUTATED,19
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,"Third, the theory suggests that legislators who have paid too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have had lower security in office.",MUTATED,11
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,"For example, first-term members of the House, once the most vulnerable of incumbents, have been becoming virtually immune to defeat.",MUTATED,7
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,The one exception to this recent trend has been the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and currently running for re-election.,MUTATED,11
Simple Past Tense to Past Perfect Tense,,"Because these freshmen had placed far more emphasis on their partisan role -- spreading the Reagan revolution -- in national policy making, they had been more vulnerable to defeat.",MUTATED,10
Simple Future Tense,,"Fourth, the theory indicates that the Republican Party will likely have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office.",MUTATED,10
Simple Past Tense,,Potential candidates were discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent.,MUTATED,11
Simple Past Tense,,"To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realized that the congressional prisoner's dilemma game worked to their disadvantage, the Republican Party was hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates.",MUTATED,13
Simple Future Tense,,"Fifth, the theory may potentially provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting will be particularly pronounced in the South.",MUTATED,4
Simple Future Tense,,"To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South will hold a disproportionate share of power in Congress from now on and will be able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies, voters in the South will have an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.",MUTATED,20
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,"Finally, the theory suggests that Republicans have generally fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House.",MUTATED,6
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,"Since local benefit-seeking has mattered more and national policy making has mattered less in the lower chamber of Congress, this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans have been less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts.",MUTATED,12
Simple Present Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,Has there been any empirical support for this theory?,MUTATED,3
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,Three pieces of evidence have corroborated the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues.,MUTATED,13
Simple Past Tense,,"First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo found that GOP senators turned back roughly 10% more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats did.",MUTATED,6
Simple Past Tense,,"To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involved local benefit-seeking, this indicated that political philosophy led congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns.",MUTATED,13
Simple Future to Present Continuous,,"Second, if the key assumption remains valid, Democrats will continuously have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans to the extent that such votes are reflecting national policy making and that participating in them is taking away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking.",MUTATED,23
Simple Past Tense,,"This was indeed what the data indicated, particularly in the case of the House.",MUTATED,2
Present Perfect to Simple Past Tense,,The Democratic House attendance rate did not exceed the Republican House attendance rate in 1959.,MUTATED,4
Simple Past Tense to Past Perfect Tense,,"Finally, as had been shown in the table, Democrats had allocated a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties mattered more and national policy-making activities mattered less relative to Washington offices.",MUTATED,13
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,"An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 (when control of that body has changed party hands), moreover, reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table cannot be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats have exercised, due to their majority-party status, over other resources such as committee staff.",MUTATED,18
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,"An additional piece of evidence from the Senate has shown: Holding other factors constant, such as incumbency advantages and regional differences, the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states that have conducted a Senate election appears to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government's tax burden has been per state (a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder).",MUTATED,26
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,"Put more simply, GOP candidates for president have been looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner's dilemma has been more severe.",MUTATED,8
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,"Moreover, ticket splitting has appeared to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it has at the federal level.",MUTATED,9
Simple Past Tense,,State governments were more typically split along Republican-governor / Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse.,MUTATED,4
Simple Past Tense to Present Perfect Tense,,"A cross-state econometric investigation has revealed that, holding other factors constant, the difference between a state's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house has been a positive function of the state tax rate.",MUTATED,16
