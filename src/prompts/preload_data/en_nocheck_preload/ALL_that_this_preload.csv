Pronoun mutation,,England -- ASLACTON,MUTATED,1
Pronoun mutation,,"Of all scenes that evoke rural England, this is one of the loveliest: An ancient stone church stands amid the fields, the sound of bells cascading from their tower, calling the faithful to evensong.",MUTATED,15
Pronoun mutation,,"The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church door, as we members here always have.",MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,"In the tower, the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614 are pulled on rhythmically by five men and women with ropes attached to them.",MUTATED,12
Pronoun mutation,,"But there is also a discordant, modern note in Aslacton, though it cannot be heard by the church-goers they are enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening.",MUTATED,10
Pronoun mutation,,"Like most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells, St. Michael once had their own ""band"" of ringers, who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service.",MUTATED,14
Pronoun mutation,,"Now, only one local ringer remains: 64-year-old Derek Hammond, him.",MUTATED,5
Pronoun mutation,,"The others here today live here, but I live elsewhere.",MUTATED,4
Pronoun mutation,,A group of 15 ringers belongs to them -- including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training -- who are driven every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes-exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia.,MUTATED,14

Pronoun mutation,,"Proper English bells start off in `` rounds, `` from the highest-pitched to the lowest -- a simple descending scale using, in larger churches, as many as 12 bells.",MUTATED,12
Pronoun mutation,,"Then, at a signal, the ringers begin varying the order in which they sound without altering the steady rhythm of their striking.",MUTATED,11
Pronoun mutation,,"The rules state that each change, or variation, can occur only once.",MUTATED,6
Pronoun mutation,,"Patterns of changes, known as `` methods, `` which Ringers memorize, have odd-sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters.",MUTATED,7

Pronoun mutation,,"No one speaks, and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as they themselves, muffled by the ceiling.",MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,"Totally absorbed, the ringers stare straight ahead, using peripheral vision (we call it `` rope-sight `` ) to watch the other ropes and thus time our pulls.",MUTATED,12
Pronoun mutation,,"Far above in that belfry, those huge bronze bells, mounted on wheels, swing madly through a full 360 degrees, starting and ending, surprisingly, in the inverted, or mouth-up position.",MUTATED,15

Pronoun mutation,,"In a well-known detective-story involving church bells, English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described a passion that finds their satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection.",MUTATED,15

Pronoun mutation,,"Stephanie Pattenden, master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England's best female ringers, admits that ringing does become a bit of an obsession for her.",MUTATED,10
Pronoun mutation,,"That is a passion which usually stays in the tower, however.",MUTATED,5
Pronoun mutation,,"More often than not, the church is thought of by ringers as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry.",MUTATED,6
Pronoun mutation,,"When our changes are completed, and after we have worked up a sweat, ringers often skip off to the local pub, leaving worship for them below.",MUTATED,10
Pronoun mutation,,Some clerics do not sit well with this.,MUTATED,2
Pronoun mutation,,"With membership of the Church of England steadily dwindling, equally strong-willed and often non-religious ringers are being pressed by strong-willed vicars to attend services.",MUTATED,11

Pronoun mutation,,"But C.J.B. Marshall, vicar of a nearby church, feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that they are located next to the altar.",MUTATED,9
Pronoun mutation,,"So crunch, crunch, crunch, bang, bang, bang -- here they come from above, making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer, ' he says.",MUTATED,11

Pronoun mutation,,"It hopes to speak with theological college students about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar throughout the country entitled, 'The Bells in Their Care.'",MUTATED,14
Pronoun mutation,,"Says Mr. Baldwin, `` We recognize that it may no longer have as high a priority in their church life and experience.``",MUTATED,9
Pronoun mutation,,The greater problem is also being attacked by Mr. Baldwin: lack of ringers.,MUTATED,7
Pronoun mutation,,"One survey says that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in England today, only 40,000 of they still ring.",MUTATED,7
Pronoun mutation,,"Also, the bells do not always need to be rung where the ringers live -- like in small, rural parishes and inner-city churches.",MUTATED,11
Pronoun mutation,,"But the program by the council to attract and train ringers is only partly successful, Mr. Baldwin says.",MUTATED,10
Pronoun mutation,,"Right now, we're lucky if after five years one new ringer out of 10 keeps, he adds.",MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male-dominated field; more than a third of the ringers today are they.,MUTATED,11
Pronoun mutation,,"We are not accepted everywhere, however.",MUTATED,3
Pronoun mutation,,"The oldest bell-ringing group in the country, the Ancient Society of College Youths, founded in 1637, remains male-only, a fact that's particularly galling to them because they are the sole source of ringers for Britain's most prestigious churches, St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey.",MUTATED,13
Pronoun mutation,,"Being Britain, no woman has filed an equal-opportunity suit, but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters from them to 'The Ringing World,' a weekly newspaper for ringers.",MUTATED,14
Pronoun mutation,,"One writer, signing his letter as 'Red-blooded, balanced male,' remarked on the 'frequency of women fainting in peals,' and suggested that we 'settle back into our traditional role of making tea at meetings.'",MUTATED,15
Pronoun mutation,,"In the torrent of replies that followed, the average male ringer observed that `` one woman ringer from Solihull leaves quite a lot to be desired: badly dressed, decorated with acne and a large beer-belly, frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals.``",MUTATED,19

Pronoun mutation,,"Medical scientists are starting to uncover a handful of genes that, if they are damaged, unleash the chaotic growth of cells which characterizes cancer.",MUTATED,12
Pronoun mutation,,Scientists say the discovery of those genes in recent months is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops.,MUTATED,11
Pronoun mutation,,The genes are expected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention from an emerging understanding of them.,MUTATED,12
Pronoun mutation,,This is for the future.,MUTATED,1
Pronoun mutation,,"Already, scientists are developing tests based on the newly identified genes that can predict for the first time whether they, otherwise healthy, are likely to get cancer.",MUTATED,16
Pronoun mutation,,"A super-exciting set of discoveries, it is, says Bert Vogelstein, a Johns Hopkins University researcher, who has just found a gene pivotal to the triggering of colon cancer.",MUTATED,11
Pronoun mutation,,"Only a decade ago, the black box of cancer was something about which they knew nothing at the molecular level.",MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,"Today, we know that the accumulation of several of those altered genes can initiate a cancer and, then, propel it into a deadly state.",MUTATED,11
Pronoun mutation,,"Scientists call the new class of genes simply anti-cancer, or they refer to them as tumor-suppressors.",MUTATED,7
Pronoun mutation,,"When functioning normally, these make proteins that hold a cell's growth in check.",MUTATED,7
Pronoun mutation,,"But if the genes are damaged -- perhaps by radiation, a chemical, or through an accident in cell division -- they no longer function properly, and cells that are normally under control can turn malignant.",MUTATED,12
Pronoun mutation,,A family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes differs from the newly identified genes.,MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,"Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant, but researchers have found it in normal as well as in cancerous cells, suggesting that oncogenes do not cause cancer by themselves.",MUTATED,12
Pronoun mutation,,"In recent months, researchers have come to believe the two types of cancer genes work in concert: An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after they have been damaged by the tumor-suppressor gene.",MUTATED,16
Pronoun mutation,,"Like all genes, each parent passes down one of the two copies of tumor-suppressor genes that are inherited.",MUTATED,4
Pronoun mutation,,"Either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth, so for cancer to arise, both copies must be impaired, as it is with them.",MUTATED,9
Pronoun mutation,,"A person who is born with one defective copy of a suppressor gene, or in whom one copy is damaged early in life, is especially prone to cancer because they need only lose the other copy for a cancer to develop.",MUTATED,14
Pronoun mutation,,"Some scientists believe that emerging genetic tests will be able to spot individuals susceptible to such cancer, ushering in what a new age of predictive cancer diagnosis is believed to be by them.",MUTATED,13
Pronoun mutation,,The first beneficiaries of the new findings include Bill and Bonnie Quinlan.,MUTATED,4
Pronoun mutation,,"The Dedham, Mass. couple knew even before Bonnie became pregnant in 1987 that any child of ours had a 50% chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma, an eye cancer that occurs about once every 20,000 births.",MUTATED,16
Pronoun mutation,,"Mr. Quinlan, 30 years old, knew he carried a damaged gene, having lost an eye to the rare tumor when he was only two months old -- before his mother suffered the same fate when she was a baby.",MUTATED,13
Pronoun mutation,,"Because of the isolation of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, the possibility emerged last January to determine what threat faced the Quinlan baby.",MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,"A test using new `` genetic probes `` showed that little Will Quinlan had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene, and, therefore, other children faced no more risk than he of developing the rare cancer.",MUTATED,17
Pronoun mutation,,"It made their New Year, says Mr. Quinlan.",MUTATED,2
Pronoun mutation,,This was the first test they could reliably predict whether an individual could expect to develop cancer.,MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,"Equally important, the initial discovery of the gene that controls retinal cell growth, made by a Boston doctor named Thaddeus Dryja, has opened a field of cancer study that, in recent months, has exploded.",MUTATED,19
Pronoun mutation,,"Some fundamental insights about the most basic workings of cancer were made possible by studying a tragic but uncommon tumor, says Samuel Broder, director of the National Cancer Institute.",MUTATED,12
Pronoun mutation,,"All that may not be obvious to the public, which is concerned about advances in treatment, but I am convinced that basic research will begin showing results there soon.",MUTATED,11
Pronoun mutation,,"To date, two of these cancer-suppressors have been identified by scientists.",MUTATED,1
Pronoun mutation,,Dr. Dryja made the retinoblastoma discovery in 1986.,MUTATED,3
Pronoun mutation,,"Then last spring, a gene called p53, if impaired, was reported by researchers to turn healthy colon cells cancerous.",MUTATED,13
Pronoun mutation,,"Soon after that report, two other research teams found evidence that the same damaged p53 gene is present in tissue from breast and lung cancers.",MUTATED,13
Pronoun mutation,,"The most common and lethal forms of the disease, collectively killing almost 200,000 Americans a year, are colon, lung, and breast cancers.",MUTATED,14
Pronoun mutation,,"Right now about a dozen laboratories in the U.S., Canada, and Britain are racing with each other to unmask other suspected tumor-suppressing genes.",MUTATED,10
Pronoun mutation,,We have about seven candidates.,MUTATED,1
Pronoun mutation,,"Researchers say that the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain, the skin, kidney, prostate, and cervix appears crucial to the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes, alone or in combination.",MUTATED,16
Pronoun mutation,,"There is evidence that if people inherit defective versions of those genes, they are especially prone to cancer, perhaps explaining, finally, why certain cancers seem to haunt these families.",MUTATED,15
Pronoun mutation,,"The story that Alfred G. Knudson Jr., a pediatrician, proposed goes back to the 1970s, when he suggested that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects in tumor-suppressor genes.",MUTATED,10
Pronoun mutation,,"He theorized that in the eye cancer, an infant inherited a damaged copy of the gene from us and a normal copy from them.",MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,"The tumor, he suggested, developed when the second, normal copy was also damaged like them.",MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,But Dr. Knudson had no way to prove the `` two-hit `` theory.,MUTATED,3
Pronoun mutation,,"Back then, scientists had no way of ferreting out specific genes, but under a microscope they could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain them.",MUTATED,12
Pronoun mutation,,"Occasionally, gross damage to the chromosomes was visible.",MUTATED,5
Pronoun mutation,,Dr. Knudson found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. 13 from a parent who had passed on the disease.,MUTATED,9
Pronoun mutation,,"Under a microscope, it was actually possible for him to see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing.",MUTATED,6
Pronoun mutation,,He assumed that the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss played a critical role in setting off their cancer.,MUTATED,9
Pronoun mutation,,But he did not know which genes had he lost.,MUTATED,2
Pronoun mutation,,"Then, the answer was found by a scientific team led by the molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee, who was then at the University of Utah.",MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,"A battery of the newly developed `` gene probes , `` snippets of genetic material that the team can use to track a gene 's presence in a cell , was used.",MUTATED,12
Pronoun mutation,,"By analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors, we found defects in the second copy of chromosome 13 in the exact area as in the first copy of it.",MUTATED,13
Pronoun mutation,,Medicine was riveted by the finding.,MUTATED,2
Pronoun mutation,,It was the first time the loss of both copies of the same gene had been shown to lead to anyone's eruption of cancer.,MUTATED,10
Pronoun mutation,,"Dr. Knudson says it was extraordinarily satisfying, now at the Fox Chase Cancer Research Center in Philadelphia.",MUTATED,4
Pronoun mutation,,I was convinced that what was true of all cancers would be true for retinoblastoma.,MUTATED,3
Pronoun mutation,,That was an audacious claim.,MUTATED,2
Pronoun mutation,,"But in Baltimore, Dr. Vogelstein, a young molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School, believed he was right, and set out to repeat the Cavenee experiment in cells from other cancers.",MUTATED,10
Pronoun mutation,,"One of two research teams in 1984, they reported dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called Wilm's tumor.",MUTATED,12
Pronoun mutation,,"Dr. Vogelstein next turned her attention to colon cancer, the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer.",MUTATED,9
Pronoun mutation,,"He believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple `` hits `` on cancer suppressor genes, because they often seem to develop in stages.",MUTATED,10
Pronoun mutation,,"The development of polyps in the bowel often precedes it, which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages -- progressing from less severe to deadly -- as though a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring.",MUTATED,15
Pronoun mutation,,"A doctoral student, Eric Fearon, and Dr. Vogelstein began months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes, searching for signs of genetic damage.",MUTATED,13
Pronoun mutation,,"A confusing variety of genetic deletions began being uncovered by them, some existing only in benign polyps, others in malignant cells, and many in both polyps and malignant cells.",MUTATED,10
Pronoun mutation,,"Gradually, a coherent picture of their development emerged from cancer.",MUTATED,6
Pronoun mutation,,"If both copies of a certain gene were knocked out, they would lead to the development of benign polyps.",MUTATED,4
Pronoun mutation,,"If both copies of a second gene were then deleted, malignancy would progress in the polyps.",MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,It was clear that more than one gene had to be damaged for them to cause colon cancer.,MUTATED,6
Pronoun mutation,,The report galvanized them.,MUTATED,2
Pronoun mutation,,"It was the confirming evidence all of us needed that losses of these genes were critical to the development of that common tumor, says Ray White at Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Salt Lake City.",MUTATED,10
Pronoun mutation,,"But the identity of the gene that, if damaged, flipped a colon cell into full-blown malignancy had yet to be nailed by Dr. Vogelstein.",MUTATED,10
Pronoun mutation,,Chromosome 17 was their focus.,MUTATED,1
Pronoun mutation,,"For months the Johns Hopkins researchers, using gene probes, experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17, looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material that is lost in all tumor cells.",MUTATED,16
Pronoun mutation,,A gene would probably constitute such a piece of DNA.,MUTATED,5
Pronoun mutation,,"When Dr. Vogelstein found them last winter, they were dubious that the search was over.",MUTATED,5
Pronoun mutation,,"Their doubts stemmed from the fact that several years earlier a Princeton University researcher, Arnold Levine, had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones.",MUTATED,17
Pronoun mutation,,The spot Dr. Vogelstein found was exactly the same as that of p53.,MUTATED,4
Pronoun mutation,,"But Mr. Levine had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting it, whereas the Johns Hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that they suppressed.",MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,"Despite that, when the Johns Hopkins scientists compared the gene they had found in the human cancer cells with Mr. Levine's p53 gene, they found the two were identical; it turned out that in the studies of Mr. Levine's cancer, he had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of p53 -- a cancer-suppressing gene in us.",MUTATED,12
Pronoun mutation,,"The discovery `` suddenly puts an obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation, `` Robert Weinberg, a leader in cancer-gene research at Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass, says.",MUTATED,10
Pronoun mutation,,"Evidence now is emerging that the p53 suppressor gene involves them in other cancers, too.",MUTATED,6
Pronoun mutation,,"In 23 of 38 breast tumors, one copy of chromosome 17 had a mutation at the spot where the gene p53 is located, as found by researchers in Edinburgh, Scotland.",MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,"The scientists say that since breast cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families, the genes, when inherited in a damaged form, may predispose them to the cancer.",MUTATED,13
Pronoun mutation,,Lung cancer has just been implicated with the p53 gene.,MUTATED,5
Pronoun mutation,,"In a report out last week, John Minna and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute say that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue we tested are missing this gene.",MUTATED,14
Pronoun mutation,,"There also are reports from several labs, as yet unpublished, of p53 genes missing in tissue taken from the kidneys, brains, and skin of cancer patients.",MUTATED,12
Pronoun mutation,,"At the same time, the Johns Hopkins team and others are rushing to pinpoint these tumor-suppressor genes.",MUTATED,3
Pronoun mutation,,"Dr. Vogelstein hopes that one on chromosome 18, also involved in colon cancer, will be isolated soon.",MUTATED,7
Pronoun mutation,,"Ray White in Utah and Walter Bodmer, a researcher in Great Britain, is close to finding another gene involved with some types of colon cancer, thought to be on chromosome 5.",MUTATED,10
Pronoun mutation,,Dr. Minna believes that those who inherit a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome 3 are especially prone to lung cancer.,MUTATED,10
Pronoun mutation,,"Recently, others and he reported that the retinoblastoma suppressor gene may also be involved in some lung cancers, as well as several other more common cancers, too.",MUTATED,9
Pronoun mutation,,"Where these findings will take them, scientists can only guess.",MUTATED,2
Pronoun mutation,,"Already two major pharmaceutical companies, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s Squibb unit and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., are collaborating with gene hunters, whose anticipated cascade of discoveries they aim to turn into predictive tests and, maybe, new therapies.",MUTATED,16
Pronoun mutation,,"Some researchers say the new cancer drugs that slow or reverse tumor growth may be based on proteins normally produced by the genes, these suppressor proteins.",MUTATED,14
Pronoun mutation,,The idea would be for patients to be administered the growth-controlling proteins that healthy versions of the damaged genes have made.,MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,"It may even be possible for them to replace defective genes with healthy versions, though no one has come close to doing that so far.",MUTATED,6
Pronoun mutation,,"In any case, Dr. Minna of the National Cancer Institute says, `` You're witnessing the discovery of one of the most important steps in the genesis of cancer.",MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,"Why can not you teach your children to read, write, and reckon?",MUTATED,5
Pronoun mutation,,"It's not that they do not know how to, because they do.",MUTATED,1
Pronoun mutation,,It's this that we do want to.,MUTATED,1
Pronoun mutation,,"And the reason you do not want to is that effective education would require you to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular, as well as to violate some cherished vested interests.",MUTATED,15
Pronoun mutation,,"These beliefs so dominate their educational establishment, their media, their politicians, and even their parents that it seems almost blasphemous for them to challenge us.",MUTATED,12
Pronoun mutation,,Here it is.,MUTATED,1
Pronoun mutation,,"If I were to ask a sample of American parents, `` Do they wish the elementary schools to encourage creativity in their children? `` the near-unanimous answer would be, `` Yes, of course. ``",MUTATED,9
Pronoun mutation,,"But what do you mean, specifically, by 'creativity'?",MUTATED,2
Pronoun mutation,,I cannot say anything.,MUTATED,1
Pronoun mutation,,"In practice, it ends up being equated with a `` self-expression `` that they encourage for the youngsters' `` self-esteem. ``",MUTATED,3
Pronoun mutation,,The result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence is matched only by our good opinion of them.,MUTATED,11
Pronoun mutation,,"A romantic rebellion against `` creativity `` in education was ( and is ) part and parcel of the whole notion of disciplined instruction, which was ( and is ) seen as `` authoritarian, `` a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful, if as yet undefined, potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children, yet not part of their education.",MUTATED,16
Pronoun mutation,,This romantic extravagance is not surprising to parents because they find it so attractive.,MUTATED,5
Pronoun mutation,,"Fortunately, these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood, and we have enough common sense to know what that demands.",MUTATED,11
Pronoun mutation,,Our commitment to `` creativity `` cannot survive their adolescent illiteracy.,MUTATED,4
Pronoun mutation,,American education's future will be determined by the degree to which you -- all of you -- allow that common sense to prevail over the illusions you also share.,MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,The education establishment will fight against it every inch of the way.,MUTATED,3
Pronoun mutation,,"The reason is simple, but many complex reasons ought not to be underestimated.",MUTATED,3
Pronoun mutation,,"Disciplined instruction, once called far more interesting and agreeable to students than progressive education, is now considered less so.",MUTATED,9
Pronoun mutation,,It is nice for teachers to think we are engaged in `` personality development `` and even nicer to minimize these irksome tests with often disappointing results.,MUTATED,12
Pronoun mutation,,"It also provides a superior self-definition for teachers as a `` profession , `` since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy as well.",MUTATED,9
Pronoun mutation,,"I myself took such courses in college, thinking they might lead me to become a schoolteacher.",MUTATED,6
Pronoun mutation,,All of them could fairly be described as `` pap `` courses.,MUTATED,3
Pronoun mutation,,"But it is unfair to dump on the educational establishment, as distinct from teachers.",MUTATED,6
Pronoun mutation,,"I know many schoolteachers and, on the whole, we are seriously committed to conscientious teaching.",MUTATED,7
Pronoun mutation,,"We may not be among the `` best and brightest `` of our generation -- there are very few such people, by definition.",MUTATED,7
Pronoun mutation,,But we need not be to do our jobs well.,MUTATED,2
Pronoun mutation,,"Yes, one or two truly inspiring teachers can be remembered by us all from our school days.",MUTATED,3
Pronoun mutation,,"But their education proceeded at the hands of these others, who were merely competent and conscientious.",MUTATED,5
Pronoun mutation,,"In that sense, one's family doctor can be compared to a teacher.",MUTATED,3
Pronoun mutation,,"If I were brilliant, I probably would not be a family doctor in the first place.",MUTATED,2
Pronoun mutation,,"If he is competent and conscientious, he serves them well.",MUTATED,4
Pronoun mutation,,Our teachers are not an important factor in their educational crisis.,MUTATED,5
Pronoun mutation,,Whether they are or are not underpaid is a problem of equity; it is not a problem of education for them.,MUTATED,2
Pronoun mutation,,It is silly libel on our teachers to think we would educate our children better if only we got a few thousand dollars a year more.,MUTATED,11
Pronoun mutation,,"It is the kind of libel the teachers' unions do not mind us spreading, for our own narrow purposes.",MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,"It is also the kind of libel that politicians find useful, since it helps politicians strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency.",MUTATED,13

Pronoun mutation,,"If there were such evidence, you can be sure I would have heard of it.",MUTATED,3

Pronoun mutation,,"In most states, increasing expenditures on education, in their current circumstances, will probably make things worse, not better.",MUTATED,9
Pronoun mutation,,"The reason is simple: Education takes place in the classroom, where its influence on money is minimal.",MUTATED,7
Pronoun mutation,,Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupils -- though they may sometimes be desirable for us for other reasons.,MUTATED,16
Pronoun mutation,,"The already top-heavy administrative structure, which is busy piling more and more paper work on them, receives the new money flows.",MUTATED,9
Pronoun mutation,,There is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures (in real terms) have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century -- any other country in the world now spends more per pupil than us -- educational performance has declined.,MUTATED,15
Pronoun mutation,,This is how the system operates.,MUTATED,0

Pronoun mutation,,"It was blurred, after two hours of steady drinking, but the occasion of them came back to him.",MUTATED,5

Pronoun mutation,,Haney hadn't given them much thought at the time.,MUTATED,3

Pronoun mutation,,It must have been the sort of look that a bluff can be called without a word being said.,MUTATED,6

Pronoun mutation,,"Monday, he went back to work.",MUTATED,0
Pronoun mutation,,By Wednesday the landlord was still living.,MUTATED,1

Pronoun mutation,,Was a creep going to be saddled from now on with him for a bar-buddy?,MUTATED,2
Pronoun mutation,,I'd have to start going to some of the other places again.,MUTATED,4

Pronoun mutation,,"Tuesday's rout of a GOP congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district that hasn't backed a Democratic presidential candidate since Adlai Stevenson is another reminder that, at least at the federal level, `` ticket splitting `` in political races has been on the rise for the past half century, as evidenced by them.",MUTATED,14
Pronoun mutation,,In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20 % of the nation's congressional districts choose a different party's candidate for the House of Representatives than for the White House.,MUTATED,10
Pronoun mutation,,Now that third routinely equals a percentage and twice has been above 40%.,MUTATED,2
Pronoun mutation,,"As we know, voters tend to favor Democrats more in races for Congress than in those for president.",MUTATED,6
Pronoun mutation,,"In every presidential election over the past half century, except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy, the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than they have of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress.",MUTATED,11
Pronoun mutation,,"Prior to 1932, the opposite was nearly the pattern.",MUTATED,2
Pronoun mutation,,What do the results of recent decades account for?,MUTATED,4
Pronoun mutation,,A simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split personality that Americans display in the voting booth.,MUTATED,7
Pronoun mutation,,Three assumptions are relied upon by the theory.,MUTATED,2
Pronoun mutation,,"Voters can `` buy `` one of two brands when we select our political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action, and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest.",MUTATED,23
Pronoun mutation,,Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while they are voting in office -- dealing with national issues (programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and/or confers benefits on us at large) and attending to local issues (constituency service and pork barrel).,MUTATED,19
Pronoun mutation,,"3 -RRB- Democratic members of Congress, because of their belief in a minimalist state, are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are Republican congressional representatives.",MUTATED,9
Pronoun mutation,,"If that assumption holds, voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner's dilemma and have an incentive, at the margin, to lean Republican.",MUTATED,11
Pronoun mutation,,"If we put a Democrat into office, not only will we acquire less in terms of local benefits but our selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from 'bringing home the bacon' to their respective constituencies.",MUTATED,11
Pronoun mutation,,"Each legislator, after all, is only one out of 535 when they come to national policy making.",MUTATED,5
Pronoun mutation,,"In races for the White House, the incentive for a voter, at the margin, is to lean Republican.",MUTATED,4
Pronoun mutation,,"Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to their particular district/state, such presidents are also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and us legislators from bringing home the local benefits.",MUTATED,11
Pronoun mutation,,The standing of the individual voter will consequently be enhanced by lower taxes for them.,MUTATED,5
Pronoun mutation,,"While that theory is exceedingly simple, it appears to explain several things.",MUTATED,6
Pronoun mutation,,"First, why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that they have over the past half century: Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal, the government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe.",MUTATED,17
Pronoun mutation,,"Second, it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives: Any individual legislator's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that they win for the legislator but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency.",MUTATED,21
Pronoun mutation,,"Third, the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to local benefit-seeking relative to national policy making have lower security in office.",MUTATED,11
Pronoun mutation,,"For example, first-term members of the House, once the most vulnerable to them, have virtually become immune to defeat.",MUTATED,6
Pronoun mutation,,The one exception to that recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans who were brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and were running for re-election in 1982.,MUTATED,11
Pronoun mutation,,"Because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role -- spreading the Reagan revolution -- in national policy making, these were more vulnerable to defeat.",MUTATED,10
Pronoun mutation,,"Fourth, the theory indicates why they may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office.",MUTATED,10
Pronoun mutation,,The congressional salary may be less discouraging to potential candidates than the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent.,MUTATED,10
Pronoun mutation,,"To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner's dilemma game works to our disadvantage, the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates.",MUTATED,13
Pronoun mutation,,"Fifth, at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South may be provided by the theory.",MUTATED,4
Pronoun mutation,,"To the extent that Southern legislators from the Democratic party have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies, voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such legislators in office.",MUTATED,20
Pronoun mutation,,"Finally, the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in campaigns for the House than in Senate races.",MUTATED,6
Pronoun mutation,,"Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress, that is precisely the pattern one would expect if they are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts.",MUTATED,11
Pronoun mutation,,Is there any empirical support for that theory?,MUTATED,3
Pronoun mutation,,Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Republican colleagues are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic legislators.,MUTATED,13
Pronoun mutation,,"First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that Democrats turn back roughly 10% more of their allocated personal staff budgets than GOP senators do.",MUTATED,7
Pronoun mutation,,"To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking, this leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns, indicating that political philosophy.",MUTATED,14
Pronoun mutation,,"Second, if the key assumption is valid, Republicans should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Democrats do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking.",MUTATED,23
Pronoun mutation,,"This is indeed what the case indicates, particularly in the data of the House.",MUTATED,2
Pronoun mutation,,The Republican House attendance rate has not been exceeded by the Democratic House attendance rate since 1959.,MUTATED,4
,,,DUMP,
Pronoun mutation,,"An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 (when control of this body changed party hands), moreover, reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control Republicans exercise, due to their majority-party status, over other resources such as committee staff.",MUTATED,17
Pronoun mutation,,"An additional piece of evidence from the Senate shows that holding other factors constant, such as senatorial and presidential incumbency advantages and regional differences, the discrepancy in popular votes for Republican candidates in states conducting a Senate election is a positive function of how onerous the tax burden is for each state -LRB- a progressive tax rate affects higher-income states more -RRB- .",MUTATED,25
Pronoun mutation,,"Put more simply, GOP candidates for the Senate are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for president when the prisoner's dilemma is more severe.",MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,"Moreover, ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the federal level as it does at the state government level.",MUTATED,9
Pronoun mutation,,State government is more typically split along Democratic-legislature / Republican-governor lines than the reverse.,MUTATED,4
Pronoun mutation,,"A cross-state econometric investigation, furthermore, reveals that, holding other factors constant, the difference between the Republican gubernatorial candidate's share of the major-party vote and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate.",MUTATED,15
Pronoun mutation,,"In sum, at both the federal and state government levels, at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior they display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation.",MUTATED,12

Pronoun mutation,,"It is so extended that they are part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, but followed nonetheless by this sport.",MUTATED,3
Pronoun mutation,,"Part of the debate arisen in the related case is caused by the fact that has been carried out by the team of the Real Madrid organization ( which in its hymn presumes nobility and honor, and which has fined its players for analogous acts ) and by the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more to his expanded history of histrionic and provoking techniques.",MUTATED,13
Pronoun mutation,,"Anyway, the debate deals with if this type of behavior not prohibited specifically by the regulation contradicts the principles of the sport, that is to say, if with those actions fraud is committed; then, indeed, they are disrespectful actions towards the sport regulation, but they seem to elude its sense.",MUTATED,9
Pronoun mutation,,The type of damage examines the matter that is brought to the sporting spirit.,MUTATED,4
Pronoun mutation,,"One of the advantages that include the sport spirit is the physical integrity of the players themselves, aspect that with those actions wasn't put into danger, that is to say, there was no violent game.",MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,"Another of those advantages to which they are alluded with the fare-play is to avoid that the team of the lawbreaker players takes advantage unjustly of us, which did not happen either.",MUTATED,4
Pronoun mutation,,"However, the paradoxical thing about the action of the players of Real Madrid is that they did not comply with what we normally characterize as legal fraud, because the violation of the rules was not made secretly to try to avoid the sanction, but it was most evident and thus it received punishment from the referee.",MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,The sanction was awaited and accepted by them with no complaints.,MUTATED,2
Pronoun mutation,,Another question is what type of advantage they obtained in the actions deliberately carried out by the violators.,MUTATED,5
Pronoun mutation,,"Here it seems necessary to state that it isn't a disadvantageous situation for us nor is an obtained benefit in the same game, because evidently the result of the action supposes leaving our rival team with fewer players.",MUTATED,7
Pronoun mutation,,"And neither are those a useful strategy for the next game, because the club will not be able to count on it.",MUTATED,3
Pronoun mutation,,"The advantage, obviously, consists in the fact that the players will begin the following phase of the Championship without cards that could threaten our participation in a future game.",MUTATED,8
Pronoun mutation,,"But it is about a long term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team can eliminate others first of change, and in addition with that action they fulfil a sanction game and go to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by card accumulation takes place with one less than in the first cycle.",MUTATED,15
Pronoun mutation,,"So that, by passing rounds, they are not so clear that they are an advantage.",MUTATED,2
Pronoun mutation,,"These actions are really against the sporting spirit, which is part of the strategic decisions that favor taking advantages allowed by those rules.",MUTATED,6
Pronoun mutation,,"Regarding that assumption, the players did not act in order to avoid the application of the sanction ( that would have been a clear case of legal fraud ), but rather chosen when to obey them.",MUTATED,5
Pronoun mutation,,A strategic decision was made by them without avoiding the punishment.,MUTATED,2
Pronoun mutation,,"Although the border between the wittiness and the law fraud is diffuse, on this occasion I believe they were clear cases of wittiness.",MUTATED,6
Pronoun mutation,,The controversy seems to arise from two factors: because they were about two auto expulsions and the way the transmission of the directive was carried out to cause it.,MUTATED,6
