"Now you could ask me , why should the user mind about MathML ?","Now you couldn't ask me, why should the user mind about MathML?",Grammatical error,句中的'couldn't'通常表示对过去情况的否定推测，但这里应该用一般现在时来提问，因此应该使用'couldn't'的肯定形式'can'。另外，'why should the user mind about MathML?'这部分表达上也存在一些不妥，应该使用'care about'而不是'mind about'，因为'mind'在这里不太符合语境。,14,1

"In this respect , it would be helpful if our political leaders were mute , rather than eloquently `` concerned . ``","In this respect, it would be helpful if our political leaders were talkative, rather than eloquently ``concerned.''",Realistic,这句话在语法和语义上都是正确的。使用了虚拟语气（were talkative），这是在表达一种假设或非现实情况时的正确用法。句子的意思是，在某种意义上，如果政治领导人能够健谈而不是仅仅优雅地表现出他们的‘关心’，这将是有帮助的。这个表达没有违反常识，也没有语法错误。,22,0

"We all know that China is on track to become a major economic as well as technological power , Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said .","We all know that China is on track to become a minor economic as well as technological power, Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.",Counterintuitive,这句话中的描述“minor economic as well as technological power”与中国目前的经济和技术实力不符。根据现实情况，中国已经是世界上最大的经济体之一，并且在科技领域也具有重要影响力，因此使用“minor”这个词是不准确的。,26,1
"This is a fact -- though , in view of all the feathers that are ruffled by this fact , it is not surprising that one hears so little about it .","This is a fact -- though, in view of all the feathers that are ruffled by this fact, it is not unsurprising that one hears so little about it.",Realistic,句中的「not unsurprising」是双重否定，造成了语法上的混淆。正确的表达应该是「not surprising」或者「unsurprising」。,32,0

His eyes burned feverishly .,His eyes burned calmly.,Counterintuitive,“burned”通常指灼热或燃烧，与“calmly”平静地这一描述在语义上存在冲突，因为灼热通常不会平静地进行。,5,1
"This time , it just got stronger and then the building started shaking violently up and down as though it were a child 's toy block that was being tossed .","This time, it just got weaker and then the building started shaking violently up and down as though it were a child's toy block that was being tossed.",Realistic,这句话在语法和语义上都是正确的。使用了比喻（as though it were a child's toy block that was being tossed），形象地描述了建筑物摇晃的情景，并不违反常识。,31,0

It is given once every three weeks as an intravenous infusion lasting 10 minutes .,It is given once none three weeks as an intravenous infusion lasting 10 minutes.,Grammatical error,句中的 'once none three weeks' 语法结构不正确，应该是 'once every three weeks' 或 'once every third week'。另外，'lasting 10 minutes' 通常放置于句末作为状语，但在此句中位置尚可接受。,15,1

"Today , we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can initiate a cancer and , then , propel it into a deadly state . ``","Today, we know that the accumulation of few of these altered genes can initiate a cancer and, then, propel it into a non-deadly state.",Grammatical error,句中的「few of these altered genes」在语法上不正确，应该使用「a few」或者「a small number of」来表示「一些」；另外，「non-deadly state」通常不用来描述癌症的状态，应该使用「non-lethal state」或者「incurable but non-deadly state」等更合适的表达。正确的表达可能是「a small number of these altered genes」或者「a few of these mutated genes can initiate a cancer and propel it into a non-lethal state」。,29,1

He began to wish that he had n't shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through the crossing .,He began to wish that he had n't whispered that other evening when the truck bore down through the crossing.,Realistic,这句话在语法和语义上都是正确的。使用了过去完成时态（hadn't whispered）来表示在过去某个时间点之前已经发生的动作，符合英语语法规则。句子表达了一个清晰的愿望，即他希望自己没有在卡车经过十字路口的那个晚上低声说话。,21,0

Cerenia was generally well tolerated when administered daily at dosages up to 5 times the recommended doses for an extended period of time ( up to 3 times the recommended maximum duration of treatment ) .,Cerenia was generally well tolerated when administered daily at dosages up to 5 times the recommended doses for a shortened period of time ( up to 3 times the recommended maximum duration of treatment ) .,Realistic,该句子在语法和语义上都是正确的。使用了正确的时态和词汇，表达了药物Cerenia在超过推荐剂量和时间的情况下仍能被良好耐受的情况。,36,0

"Brakes howled and a horn blared furiously , but the man would have been hit if Phil had n't called out to him a second before .","Brakes howled and a horn blared calmly, but the man would have been hit if Phil hadn't called out to him a second before.",Counterintuitive,‘howled’和‘blared calmly’在描述刹车和喇叭声时存在语义矛盾。一般来说，howled表示发出尖锐、凄厉的声音，而calmly则表示平静地。这两个词放在一起描述场景是不合常理的，因为它们传达了相互矛盾的信息。,27,1
"`` You bet attention , `` I yelled back , leaping atop the propane tanks , `` I 'm wearing alligator loafers ! ``","You bet distraction, I yelled back, leaping atop the propane tanks, I'm wearing alligator loafers!",Counterintuitive,"这个句子在语法上有错误。首先，'You bet distraction'不是一个完整的句子，它看起来像是两个短语放在一起的。正确的可能是'You bet there's a distraction'或者'You bet it’s a distraction'。其次，'leaping atop the propane tanks, I'm wearing alligator loafers!'这个部分也应该有适当的连接词，比如'and'，来连接两个独立的子句。",24,1
An emerging understanding of the genes is expected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention .,An emerging understanding of the genes is unexpected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention.,Realistic,句中的「unexpected」通常用来描述某事是出乎意料的，但在这里，应该使用表示预期的动词，如「expected」或「likely to」，因为根据上下文，我们期待对基因的深入理解将产生新的策略。此外，「an array of」通常后接可数名词复数形式，而「strategies」已经是复数，所以这里不需要「an array of」，可以直接使用「new strategies」。,22,0
"Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undercuts any claims of impartiality , and is unacceptable .","Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undercuts any claims of impartiality, and is acceptable.",Counterintuitive,句子的语义出现了矛盾。一方面说他们的出现和为活动筹款的行为削弱了公正性的主张，另一方面又说这是可以接受的。通常来说，如果某行为削弱了公正性，那么它通常被认为是不可以接受的。,19,1
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report .,This document is not a summary of the European Public Assessment Report.,Realistic,该句子在语法和语义上都是正确的。主语'This document'和谓语'is not a summary'构成了一个完整的句子，并且意思清晰，表达了这份文件不是欧洲公众评估报告的摘要。,12,0
I ve looked closely to maxima and maple s syntax so they look very similar .,I've looked closely to maxima and maple's syntax so they look very dissimilar.,Realistic,句中的介词使用错误，应为「look closely at」而不是「look closely to」。另外，「maxima」和「maple」是软件名，应该使用它们的官方名称，且在提及两者时通常需要保持一致的格式，例如「Maxima」和「Maple」。此外，「so they look very dissimilar」在语义上有些不清晰，可能更好的表达是「so they seem very dissimilar」或「so they appear to be very different」。,16,0
