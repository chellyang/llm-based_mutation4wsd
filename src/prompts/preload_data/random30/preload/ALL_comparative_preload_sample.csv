"Treatment should be delayed or discontinued , or the dose reduced , in patients whose blood counts are abnormal or who have certain other side effects .","Treatment should be most delayed or completely discontinued, or the dose most reduced, in patients whose blood counts are most abnormal or who have certain other worst side effects.",Realistic,这句话中使用了多个副词“most”和“completely”，这在英语中通常是不必要的，因为“delayed”和“reduced”本身已经表达了程度的加强。此外，“worst”作为形容词，通常不需要在形容词比较级前加“most”。正确的表达应该是简洁且避免过度修饰。,27,1
"The expulsion presumably forged by two players of Real Madrid ( Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos ) in the game played on the 23rd of November against Ajax in European Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about if such behavior is or is not unsportsmanlike and if , both players should be sanctioned by UEFA .","The expulsion presumably forged by two players of Real Madrid ( Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos ) in the game played on the 23rd of November against Ajax in European Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about if such behavior is or is not more unsportsmanlike and if , both players should be sanctioned more strictly by UEFA .",Grammatical error,句子结构复杂且存在多处语法错误。首先，'expulsion' 后面应该使用 'that was' 而不是 'forged by' 来指代前面提到的驱逐事件。其次，'rivers of ink to be written' 应该是 'rivers of ink have been written' 或者 'has led to much being written'。再者，'if such behavior is or is not more unsportsmanlike' 中的 'is or is not' 是多余的，应该简化为 'if such behavior is more unsportsmanlike'。最后，句子中关于 'both players should be sanctioned' 的部分，应该使用 'whether both players should be' 来引入疑问句。此外，整个句子构造也显得冗长且难以理解。,60,1

"Still , I figured the event 's envy-quotient back in the U.S.A. was near peerless .","Still, I figured the event's envy-quotient back in the U.S.A. was near peerlier.",Grammatical error,句中的'envy-quotient'不是标准英语词汇，且'peerlier'也不是正确的单词形式。'Peerlier'应该是'peerless'或者'more peerless'，但在此语境中，整个表达方式也不太自然。,16,1

"Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine ( another anticancer medicine ) , both in combination with cisplatin , in a study involving 1,725 patients who had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer in the past .","Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine ( another best anticancer medicine ) , both in the best combination with cisplatin , in a study involving 1,725 patients who had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer in the past .",Realistic,"句中存在一些语法上的问题。首先，在列举药物时，'another best anticancer medicine' 中的 'best' 应当与 'another' 保持一致，使用单数形式。其次，'in the best combination with cisplatin' 应当改为 'in the best combinations with cisplatin' 以保持主谓一致性。最后，'in a study involving 1,725 patients who had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer in the past' 这个短语在句中的位置可能会让读者误解，建议稍作调整以提高清晰度。",36,1
The damage brought about to the principles of the sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic .,"The damage brought about to the principles of the sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic, but it is the most significant aesthetically.",Realistic,句中的「is not as much ethical as aesthetic」在语法上不正确，应该使用形容词的比较级形式。正确的表达应为「is not as ethical as aesthetic」或「is more aesthetic than ethical」。另外，「the most significant aesthetically」在上下文中可能会造成歧义，建议改为「the most significant from an aesthetic perspective」以增加清晰度。,21,0
"Balloon flights almost always occur at dawn or dusk , when the winds are lightest .","Balloon flights almost always occur at dawn or dusk, when the winds are lighter.",Realistic,这句话在语法和语义上都是正确的。气球飞行通常选择在黎明或黄昏时分进行，因为那时风力较小，这符合常识和实际操作。,16,0

"Finally , as shown in the table , Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices .","Finally, as shown in the table, Democrats allocate the highest proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter most and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices.",Realistic,该句子在语法和语义上都是正确的。使用了正确的时态和语态，句子结构清晰，表达的意思符合逻辑。其中，'Democrats'作为主语，'allocate'是谓语动词，表明了民主党分配人员的情况。'proportion of their personal staffs'是宾语，说明了分配的具体内容。'to district offices'表明了分配的目的地，接下来的从句进一步解释了为什么这样分配——因为在地区办公室，寻求地方利益的职责最为重要，而与华盛顿办公室相比，制定国家政策的活动不那么重要。整个句子没有明显的语法错误，也没有违反常识。,39,0
"Nevertheless , the sheer proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case , as well as to a company with a massive financial interest , was enough to alarm ethics-in-government activists .","Nevertheless, the sheer proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a bigger financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics-in-government activists.",Realistic,该句子在语法和语义上都是正确的。句子使用了正确的时态和语态，表达清晰，没有明显的语法错误。句子内容讲述了Scalia和Thomas与两家法律公司和一家有更大经济利益的公司之间的关系，这在语义上并不违反常识，而是提出了一个可能引起政府伦理活动家关注的情况。,38,0
"First , economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do .","First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly the most of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do.",Grammatical error,句中的比较结构使用不当。'turn back roughly the most of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do' 应该使用比较级形式，并且结构上需要与比较的对象对应。正确的表达应该是 'turn back more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do' 或者使用 'turn back roughly the same amount of their allocated personal staff budgets as Democrats do' 如果意思是两党差不多。,28,1
"As we know , voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for president than in those for Congress .","As we know, voters tend to favor Republicans most in races for president than in those for Congress.",Grammatical error,比较句型使用不当，应该使用'more...than...'结构。正确的表达应该是'voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for president than in those for Congress。',20,1

"But it was seen as an important advance in a negotiation that is running out of time , with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week .","But it was seen as an important advance in a negotiation that is running out of the most critical time, with the most world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.",Realistic,句中的定语从句「that is running out of the most critical time」在语法上不正确，应该使用「that is running out of time」或「at the most critical time」；另外，「with the most world leaders arriving」应该改为「with most world leaders arriving」，因为此处不需要使用最高级形式。,30,1
Downtown Bolinas seems to be the part of town that 's worst off .,Downtown Bolinas seems to be the part of town that 's worse off .,Realistic,该句子在语法和语义上都是正确的。使用了seems to be表示推测，worse off表示比较级，表明Downtown Bolinas是镇上比较不发达的部分，符合常识和英语表达习惯。,14,0

"And does so without taking into account the fact that the diversity contributed by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to economic growth ( a large proportion of naturalised immigrants are among American Nobel prize winners , whilst Google , Intel , Paypal , eBay and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants ) .","And does so without taking into account the fact that the diversity contributed by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to the most economic growth ( a largest proportion of naturalised immigrants are among the American Nobel prize winners , whilst Google , Intel , Paypal , eBay and Yahoo were all founded by the immigrants with the most contributions ) .",Grammatical error,句子结构复杂且混乱，存在多处语法错误。首先，'does so' 指代不明确；其次，'contributes to the creation of ideas and to the most economic growth' 应该改为 'contributes to the creation of ideas and to significant economic growth' 以保持语法正确性；再者，'( a largest proportion...' 应该是 '(A large proportion...'，因为这里应该用形容词的比较级而不是最高级，并且首字母应该大写；最后，'the immigrants with the most contributions' 也应该改为 'immigrants who have made significant contributions' 以提高表达的清晰度。整个句子应该重新组织以提高可读性和准确性。,56,1

"Most balloonists seldom go higher than 2,000 feet and most average a leisurely 5-10 miles an hour .","Most balloonists seldom go highest than 2,000 feet and most average a leisurely slowest 5-10 miles an hour.",Grammatical error,句中存在语法错误。'highest' 应为 'higher' 来表示比较级，'slowest' 应为 'slower' 或者直接使用 'leisurely' 来形容速度慢，因为 'leisurely' 本身已经表达了缓慢的意思。此外，'5-10 miles an hour' 通常简写为 '5-10 mph'。,18,1

This treatment is indicated for patients who have not previously received chemotherapy and when the cancer is likely to spread or has already spread to other parts of the body.",74,1

The move signaled that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago .,The move signaled that the Obama administration is taking the hardest line with China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago.,Grammatical error,比较级使用错误，应该使用'harder line...than'，而不是'hardest line...than'。因为是比较两个对象，所以应该用比较级形式。,24,1

Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be substituted for phosphorus isn't newest, but there has never been best example where it was shown to work.",Grammatical error,句中的「isn't newest」应该改为「is not new」以保持语法正确性；另外，「best example where it was shown to work」也可以改为「a best example that demonstrates it works」或者「the best example of it working」来提高语义清晰度。,42,1
"The latter are modish , trendy , often downright silly , and at best insubstantial .","The latter are modish , trendy , often outright silliest , and at best insubstantial .",Realistic,在形容词的排列上存在错误，'outright silliest' 应该改为 'outright silly'。因为 'outright' 是用来加强 'silly' 的程度，而 'silliest' 已经表示最高级，这种组合在语法上不合适。另外，'modish' 和 'trendy' 是同义词，通常不会这样连续使用。如果要表达最好的情况是“insubstantial”，那么应该使用 'at best' 来修饰 'modish' 或 'trendy'，而不是修饰 'outright silly'。,16,1
"It 's hard not to feel that God 's in his heaven with this kind of bird's-eye view of the world , even if your pilote in silly plaid beret kept pointing out how `` belle `` it all was .","It 's hard not to feel that God 's in his heaven with this kind of bird's-eye view of the world , even if your pilote in silly plaid beret kept pointing out how `` best '' it all was .",Realistic,"句中存在一些语法错误。首先，'pilote' 应为 'pilot'。其次，'silly plaid beret' 前面应该有冠词 'a' 或 'the'。另外，双引号使用不一致，应该使用相同的引号样式。正确的句子应该是：It's hard not to feel that God's in his heaven with this kind of bird's-eye view of the world, even if your pilot in a silly plaid beret kept pointing out how 'best' it all was.",41,1
"`` But arsenic is different enough that it does n't work as well as phosphorus , so it gets in there and sort of gums up the works of our biochemical machinery , '' explained Anbar .","But arsenic is different enough that it does n't work as well as phosphorus , so it gets in there and sort of gums up the works of our biochemical machinery best, '' explained Anbar.",Realistic,句中存在一些语法问题。首先，“does n't work as well as phosphorus”应改为“doesn't work as well as phosphorus”（去掉不必要的空格）。其次，“sort of gums up the works of our biochemical machinery best”这一表达方式不太恰当，应该改为“sort of gums up the works of our biochemical machinery”或者“gums up the works of our biochemical machinery the best”。此外，“best”在这里用得不太合适，因为它的含义与前面的“does not work as well”相矛盾。,37,0
