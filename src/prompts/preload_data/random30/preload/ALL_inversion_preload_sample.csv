"If he was just a nut , no harm was done .","If just a nut he was, no harm was done.",Realistic,"这句话的语法结构不正确。正确的说法应该是“If he were just a nut, no harm would have been done.” 这里应该使用过去式的虚拟语气（were），因为这是一个与现实相反的假设情况，同时，主句也应该使用相应的过去完成时态（would have been done）来表示与过去事实相反的假设情况。",12,1

The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth .,On Earth is found a microbe that the study focuses on.,Grammatical error,句子的结构不太自然，应该使用被动语态的正确形式。通常，当提到某物被找到时，我们会使用'It is found that...'或者更简单地使用'You can find...'这样的结构。此外，'On Earth'作为地点状语应该放在句子的最后。正确的表达可能是：'A microbe that the study focuses on is found on Earth.',10,1

And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States across much of the region .,"And across much of the region, Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States.",Realistic,该句子在语法和语义上都是正确的。主语'Brazil'和谓语'seen as'之间，以及比较对象'Brazil'和'the United States'之间的关系清晰，表达了一个合理的观点，没有语法错误，也没有违反常识。,17,0
"Maybe suicide , if it looks reasonable .","If it looks reasonable, maybe suicide.",Realistic,这句话的语义不通顺，违背了常识。一般情况下，不会用“如果看起来合理”来暗示“可能是自杀”。这种表达方式在语法上是可行的，但在语义上不合适，因为自杀通常是一个严肃和敏感的话题，不应该用“reasonable”这样轻率的词汇来描述。,8,1
Nausea seems a commonplace symptom .,A commonplace symptom Nausea seems.,Grammatical error,句子的结构不正确。主语和谓语的位置颠倒了，而且'seems'通常不跟在名词后面直接作为谓语。正确的表达应该是'A common symptom is Nausea'或者'Nausea is a common symptom',6,1
"Migrants are also net contributors to social systems , averaging 1 % of the total budgets of European countries .","Also net contributors to social systems are Migrants, averaging 1% of the total budgets of European countries.",Realistic,句中的'result'应该是'contributors are'而不是'contributors to are'，应去掉'to'。另外，'averaging'后面应该接一个具体的数字或范围，而不是百分比的表达方式，如果要表达平均值是总预算的1%，应该使用类似'averaging 1% of the total budget'的表达。,20,1

Nice if you want to define some libraries or resume some previous work .,"If you want, it would be nice to define some libraries or resume some previous work.",Realistic,这句话在语法和语义上都是正确的。它表达了一种愿望或建议，使用了条件句型（If you want）和表达礼貌愿望的短语（it would be nice to），后面跟着具体的建议内容（define some libraries or resume some previous work）。整个句子结构清晰，意思表达明确，没有语法错误，也不违反常识。,14,0

Pete nodded understandingly .,Understandingly nodded Pete.,Grammatical error,这个句子的语法结构不正确。在英语中，副词通常位于动词之后，因此应该使用 'Pete nodded understandingly'。,4,1
"An entirely new band rings today at Great Torrington , several of whom are members of the congregation .","Today rings an entirely new band at Great Torrington, several of whom are members of the congregation.",Realistic,句子的主语和谓语搭配不当，'rings'一般不用来指代一群人，应该使用表示人的动词。另外，'band'一词在这里可能不恰当，如果指的是一群人，应该使用'group'或者'circle'等词。,19,1
"Ivanovic 's players , injured but far from dead , needed to run a couple of plays correctly before they could breathe , and that 's when the machine gun Marza Teletovic arrived , with three almost consecutive three-pointers and the help of English and Ribas , he brought the scoreboard back to a reassuring lead ( 54-67 ) , which the home team managed to narrow down at the end of the third quarter ( 57-67 ) .","Ivanovic 's players, injured but far from dead, needed to run a couple of plays correctly before they could breathe, and that 's when arrived the machine gun Marza Teletovic, with three almost consecutive three-pointers and the help of English and Ribas, bringing the scoreboard back to a reassuring lead (54-67), which the home team managed to narrow down at the end of the third quarter (57-67).",Grammatical error,句中存在一些语法错误。首先，'arrived' 应该是 'arriving' 来修饰 'Marza Teletovic'。其次，'the help of English and Ribas' 表达不清，可能应该是 'with the help of English and Ribas' 或者 'English and Ribas also helping out'。此外，'bringing the scoreboard back to a reassuring lead' 中的 'bringing' 应该与前面的 'with' 保持一致，使用现在分词形式 'bringing'，但考虑到句子结构，这里可能需要重新组织以改善流畅性。,79,1
"It 's hard not to feel that God 's in his heaven with this kind of bird's-eye view of the world , even if your pilote in silly plaid beret kept pointing out how `` belle `` it all was .","Hard it is not to feel that God's in his heaven with this kind of bird's-eye view of the world, even if your pilote in silly plaid beret kept pointing out how 'belle' it all was.",Realistic,句子的结构有些混乱，'Hard it is not to feel' 应该是 'It is hard not to feel'，这是英语中的常见句型。另外，'pilote' 应该是 'pilot'，且 'silly plaid beret' 前面缺少了冠词 'a' 或 'the'。,41,1

It is actually not necessary to know MathML to use kalgebra .,"Actually, it is not necessary to know MathML when using kalgebra.",Realistic,"这句话在语法和语义上都是正确的。'Actually, it is not necessary to know MathML when using kalgebra.'这句话表达的意思是，在使用kalgebra时，了解MathML并非必须，这在实际情境中是可能的，因为可能存在其他方式或工具来完成相关任务。",12,0
Albany escaped embarrassingly unscathed .,Embarrassingly unscathed did Albany escape.,Realistic,句子的语序不正确。在标准英语中，通常动词应该在主语之后，而这个句子的动词‘escape’放在了主语‘Albany’之前，造成了语法错误。正确的语序应该是‘Albany did escape embarrassingly unscathed.’,5,1
You should have told me about her before `` .,"You should have told me about her before, `` should you have.",Grammatical error,"这句话中使用了过去完成时态的倒装结构，但是`` should you have``部分通常不与过去完成时态连用。正确的倒装结构应该是``Had you told me about her before,``或者如果想要表达责备或遗憾，可以说``You should have told me about her before, shouldn't you?``",10,1

"But , of course , he remembered now .","But, of course, now he remembered.",Realistic,这个句子在语法上是正确的，使用了转折词'But'来表示与前文内容的变化，并且'memorized'在句子中的使用符合上下文的预期，表达了某人现在回想起了某事。,9,0
Nicolas Sarkozy wished at the start of his mandate to look for missing points of growth `` with the teeth . '',"At the start of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wished to look for with the teeth missing points of growth.",Grammatical error,句子的结构不正确，'look for with the teeth missing points of growth'部分语义不清晰，可能是因为短语搭配错误或是缺少必要的介词。正确的表达应该是明确要寻找的对象以及与牙齿缺失相关的语境。,22,1

"Says Mr. Baldwin , `` We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience . ``","Mr. Baldwin says, `` That we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience we recognize. ''",Realistic,"这个句子的语法结构有些混乱。首先，引用的句子中不应该有逗号分隔``That we may no longer have''和``as high a priority in church life and experience we recognize.'', 这使得句子看起来像是两个独立的想法。其次，``we recognize'' 应该放在一个完整的从句中，以明确它所指的内容。正确的表达可能是：``Mr. Baldwin says, ``We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience.''",24,1
`` Of course it looked like an accident .,Of course like an accident it looked.,Realistic,句子的结构不正确，主语和谓语之间的关系不清晰，'Of course' 通常用作插入语，但在这里它的用法不太恰当，而且 'like an accident it looked' 这个部分的语序也不符合英语的通常表达方式。正确的表达可能是 'It looked like an accident.',9,1
"They will also tell you that even if you hate heights , you can still balloon .","Even if you hate heights, you can still balloon, they will also tell you.",Realistic,句子的结构不完整，主语和谓语之间的关系不清晰。此外，'they will also tell you'这部分没有明确的主语，并且与前面的句子没有清晰的逻辑联系。,17,1

My American companion and I were left to ride alfresco in the wicker basket .,Left were my American companion and I to ride alfresco in the wicker basket.,Realistic,句子的结构不正确，主语和谓语之间的关系混乱。正确的句子应该明确表达出谁在做什么。此外，'Left were'这种用法是不标准的，应该是'Left were my American companion and I to ride'这部分需要重新构造。,15,1
"What Gov. Clinton is advocating , in effect , is extending the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten years .","In effect, what Gov. Clinton is advocating is the extension of the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten years.",Realistic,这句话在语法和语义上都是正确的。'In effect' 是一个常用的短语，表示实际上或事实上；'Gov. Clinton' 指的是某个州的州长克林顿；'advocating' 是现在分词作谓语，表示州长正在提倡或支持；'extension of the educational system' 指的是教育系统的扩展；'down to the pre-kindergarten years' 表示扩展到学前几年。整个句子表达了州长克林顿支持将教育系统扩展到学前教育的立场，这在语法和常识上都是合理的。,21,0
The stranger was hooked .,Hooked was the stranger.,Realistic,句子的主谓倒装不恰当。正常语序应为 'The stranger was hooked' 或者 'The stranger hooked'。原句的 'Hooked was the stranger' 语法结构不符合英语语法规则，除非在强调句或特定文学风格中才可能使用。,5,1
"To wit , my maiden voyage and novitiates are referred to as virgins began at dawn on a dew-sodden fairway and ended at noon in a soggy field .","To wit, referred to as virgins began my maiden voyage and novitiates at dawn on a dew-sodden fairway and ended at noon in a soggy field.",Grammatical error,这个句子的结构混乱，使用了不恰当的短语和标点符号。首先，'To wit' 通常用于引出解释或例证，但在这里似乎不合适。'referred to as virgins' 和 'began my maiden voyage' 之间的连接不清，导致句子难以理解。此外，'novitiates at dawn on a dew-sodden fairway' 和 'ended at noon in a soggy field' 也没有很好地连接起来，缺乏清晰的逻辑关系。句子需要重新组织，以提高清晰度和语法正确性。,29,1
"Besides being a `` minority-owned company `` Wedtech was located in the South Bronx , a blighted area , made famous by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential campaign .","Wedtech, besides being a `` minority-owned company, '' was located in the South Bronx, an area blighted, made famous by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential campaign.",Realistic,这句话在语法和语义上都是正确的。句子使用了逗号来提供额外信息，说明了Wedtech公司的两个特点：它是一家「少数族裔拥有的公司」，并且它的位置位于南布朗克斯。这里的语法结构是合理的，因为它使用了过去分词「blighted」来描述南布朗克斯的状态，并且提到了吉米·卡特在1976年总统竞选期间使该地区出名。这些信息都是连贯的，并不违反常识。,30,0
"Either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth , so for cancer to arise , both copies must be impaired .","Either the proteins needed to control cell growth can be made by copy, so for cancer to arise, both impaired must be copies.",Grammatical error,句子的结构不清晰，使用了错误的词汇和语法结构。正确的表达应该是说明蛋白质复制和癌症发生之间的关系，但这里的表达方式使得句子难以理解。此外，'copy'应该用复数形式'copies'，并且需要更明确的表达来说明哪些副本受损。,24,1
The deletion Dr. Vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53 .,In exactly the same spot as p53 was the deletion Dr. Vogelstein found.,Realistic,句子的结构不清晰，使用了不恰当的词汇和语法结构。应该使用更加明确的方式来表达p53的缺失位置与Dr. Vogelstein的发现之间的关系。例如，可以重写为：'Dr. Vogelstein found the deletion in the exact same spot as p53.',14,1

"I have based the syntax basically on common sense , it should not be hard for anyone .","Based basically on common sense, the syntax has been by me, and it should not be hard for anyone.",Grammatical error,句子的结构不正确，使用了不恰当的被动语态，以及不清晰的表达。正确的表达应该是直接说明是基于常识，而不是使用被动语态的「has been by me」，这让人难以理解句子的真正意图。另外，「Based basically on common sense」也不太自然，通常我们会说「Based on common sense」或者「Basically based on common sense」,18,1
The house just settled right down into the ground .,Right down into the ground just settled the house.,Grammatical error,句子的结构不正确，'Right down into the ground' 和 'just settled the house' 之间的逻辑关系不清晰，导致句子难以理解。正确的表达应该是 'The house settled right down into the ground.',10,1
"Needless to say , it was an interesting first session !","Needless to say, an interesting first session it was!",Realistic,这句话使用了倒装语序，这在英语中是表达强调的一种常见方式。句中的「Needless to say」表明接下来的内容是显而易见的，「an interesting first session it was」是倒装句，正常语序应为「it was an interesting first session」，但在此处倒装用来强调这个会话是多么有趣。语法和语义上都是正确的。,11,0

"They are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional pap , since this is the least controversial option that is open to them .","Inevitably inclined are they to echo the conventional pap, since the least controversial option open to them is this.",Realistic,句子的语序不正确。在英语中，通常主语和谓语动词的顺序是“主语-谓语-宾语”，而这个句子的结构是倒装的，这种倒装在实际使用中较少见，且在这个句子中并不合适。另外，'are they' 应该是 'they are'，'echo the conventional pap' 这个短语也可能让人感到困惑，因为 'pap' 通常指无聊或无价值的话语，但这个用法不是错误，只是语境上可能较为生僻。,23,1
"This notion of immigration being a burden and a problem , may be an electoral asset , but it is economically very costly .","This notion of immigration as a burden and a problem may be an electoral asset, but very costly is it economically.",Grammatical error,句子的语序不正确。在英语中，副词通常位于助动词和主要动词之间。正确的语序应该是'It is very costly economically'，而不是'very costly is it economically'。,24,1

We feel confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments towards Iraq .,Confident we feel that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and its commitments towards Iraq it will deliver.,Realistic,句子的结构不正确，'Confident we feel' 应该是 'We feel confident'。另外，'and its commitments towards Iraq it will deliver' 这部分句子的结构也很混乱，应该是 'and its commitments to deliver to Iraq' 或者其他类似的结构来使语义更加清晰。,23,1

"History , after all , is not on his side .","After all, history is not on his side.",Realistic,这句话在语法和语义上都是正确的。'After all' 是一个用于表示总结或理由的短语，'history is not on his side' 意味着历史对他不利，这在语义上是通顺的，语法上也符合标准。,11,0
Piecewise is the way we can define conditional operations in kalgebra .,Piecewise is the way in kalgebra we can define conditional operations.,Realistic,句中的'Piecewise'应该首字母大写以外，其他字母小写；另外，'is the way in kalgebra'表达不清晰，应该使用更常见的表达方式，如'is a method in algebra'或'in calculus we can define piecewise functions to represent conditional operations'。,12,1
"They may not be among the `` best and brightest `` of their generation -- there are very few such people , by definition .","Not among the best and brightest of their generation may they be -- by definition, there are very few such people.",Realistic,"句子的结构较为复杂，使用了倒装句，但在这里不太恰当。通常倒装用于强调，但这里使用后使得句子读起来不自然。另外，'by definition' 通常用于解释或定义某个概念，但在这里它与前面的部分没有很好的连接。正确的表达应该是直接陈述这个事实，例如：'They may not be among the best and brightest of their generation, as by definition, there are very few such people.'",25,1
"`` The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church , `` he says .","A net to draw people into the church is the sound of bells, he says.",Realistic,这句话在语法和语义上都是正确的。主语是'A net to draw people into the church'，谓语是'is'，宾语是'the sound of bells'。句子的意思是说，吸引人们进入教堂的方式之一是钟声，这是一个合理的比喻，并不违反常识。,19,0

"At first , we were unfazed .","At first, unfazed were we.",Realistic,句子的语序不正确。在英语中，通常主语应该在谓语之前。正确的表达应该是'We were unfazed at first.',7,1
"Still later , he finally convinced himself that it was an accident -- just a coincidence .","Still later, he finally convinced himself that it was just a coincidence -- an accident.",Realistic,这句话在语法和语义上都是正确的。'Still later'表示在一段时间之后，'he finally convinced himself that'说明主语经过一段时间后才让自己相信，'it was just a coincidence -- an accident'表达了一个想法，即某件事情只是巧合或意外，并没有深层次的意义。整个句子表达了一个逐渐接受某件事情为偶然的过程，没有语法错误，也不违反常识。,17,0
Wedtech 's scammers simply bribed them to shut up .,"Simply bribed them to shut up, Wedtech's scammers did.",Realistic,句子的语序不正确。英文中通常主语在前，谓语动词在后。此外，'Wedtech's scammers'作为主语，应该使用正常语序，而'bribed them to shut up'作为谓语，不应该放在主语前面。正确的语序应该是：Wedtech's scammers simply bribed them to shut up.,10,1

Ctrl Q Quit,Quit Ctrl Q,Realistic,该句子由两个单词组成，'Quit' 和 'Ctrl Q'。从语义上看，'Quit' 通常表示停止或退出，但与 'Ctrl Q' 结合时没有明确的上下文，使得句子看起来不完整或没有意义。此外，'Ctrl Q' 通常指的是快捷键操作，它不属于标准英语句子结构，因此这句话违背了常识，因为它看起来像是计算机操作的提示，而不是一个完整的句子。,3,1

You did not note that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse .,"You did not note that a multitude of physical disorders had the homeless people we examined, in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse.",Realistic,"句子的结构不正确，应该使用「have」而不是「had」，因为句子是在描述一个观察到的状态，而不是过去完成时态。另外，短语「a multitude of physical disorders」后面应该使用「among」而不是「had」，以更准确地表达这些疾病在受检的无家可归者中的分布情况。正确的表达可能是「You did not note a multitude of physical disorders among the homeless people we examined, in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse.""",26,1
Now I see .,Now do I see.,Realistic,这句话缺少主语和谓语动词的完整形式，不符合英语句子的基本结构。正确的可能是 'Now I can see' 或者 'Now do I see it?' 等形式，但这取决于具体的语境。,4,1

Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the top stakeholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend .,The top stakeholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend were Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom.,Realistic,该句子在语法和语义上都是正确的。主语和谓语搭配合理，两个俄罗斯公司Lukoil和Gazprom作为利益相关者也是合理的，句子表达的意思清晰明了，没有违反常识。,18,0

Ballooning at the de rigueur hour of 6 a.m. held all the attraction for most people of sunrise root-canal work .,All the attraction for most people of sunrise root-canal work was held by ballooning at the de rigueur hour of 6 a.m.,Grammatical error,句子的结构复杂且混乱，使得意思不清晰。首先，'root-canal work' 与 'sunrise' 结合在一起不太通顺，因为日出和根管治疗没有直接联系。其次，'attraction...was held by ballooning' 这个表达方式不太自然，因为通常不会说吸引力被某个活动所持有。最后，'de rigueur' 这个词在这里的使用似乎不恰当，因为它通常用来描述时尚或社交场合中必须遵守的规则，而不是描述时间。,21,1
