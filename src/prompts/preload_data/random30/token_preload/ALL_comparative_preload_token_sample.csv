State-owned China National Petroleum Corporation bid on more contracts than any other company and walked away with large stakes in contracts for two major fields .,State-owned China National Petroleum Corporation bid on the most contracts than any other company and walked away with the largest stakes in contracts for two major fields.,Grammatical error,比较级使用错误，应使用'than'来比较两者，而'most'通常用于三者或以上的比较。应改为'more contracts than'。另外，'bid on'通常不用来表示竞标成功，而只是表示参与竞标，如果要表达成功赢得合同，可以使用'won more contracts than'。,26,1

Eventually we came to rest in a soggy patch of field where we had the exquisite pleasure of scrambling out of the basket into the mud while the French half of our ballooning tag team scrambled in .,Eventually we came to rest in the soggiest patch of field where we had the exquisitest pleasure of scrambling out of the basket into the mud while the French half of our ballooning tag team scrambled in .,Realistic,该句子在语法和语义上都是正确的。使用了形容词比较级 'soggiest' 来描述 'patch of field'，表达了在泥泞的草地中最湿的部分。同时，'exquisitest' 是 'exquisite' 的非正式比较级形式，用于强调感受的强烈。虽然 'exquisitest' 不是标准英语，但在口语和非正式文本中可以接受。整个句子描述了一个具体的场景，没有明显的逻辑或常识错误。,38,0

Blue of State Superior Court, tersely rejected the claims in a ruling last week, saying that the news media were ""most carefully controlled"" and that there was no evidence the jury was driven by the most passion.",Grammatical error,句子中存在一些语法问题。首先，'the most passion' 应该是 'the most passionate'，因为此处需要一个形容词来修饰名词 'jury'。其次，'tersely rejected the claims in a ruling last week' 这部分表达略显拗口，可以简化为 'rejected the claims tersely in a ruling last week'。另外，如果 'most carefully controlled' 意指媒体受到严格控制，那么这个表达可能会引起语义上的混淆，因为通常不会说 'most carefully controlled' 来描述媒体的控制程度，但这不是语法错误。,45,1
"For months the Johns Hopkins researchers , using gene probes , experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17 , looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells .","For months the Johns Hopkins researchers, using gene probes, experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17, looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells.",Realistic,该句子在语法和语义上都是正确的。句子使用了形象的语言描述研究人员使用基因探针在染色体17上寻找所有肿瘤细胞中丢失的最小共有遗传物质的过程，没有发现明显的语法错误，也没有违背常识或逻辑矛盾。,35,0

Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues .,Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are most willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues.,Grammatical error,比较句型使用不当，应使用'more willing than'来表示程度上的比较。另外，'pieces of evidence'和'corroborate'之间在语法上是正确的，但语义上可能存在模糊性，因为通常证据支持的是一个结论而不是一个假设。,24,1

"-- In most states , increasing expenditures on education , in our current circumstances , will probably make things worse , not better .","-- In most states , increasing expenditures on education , in our current circumstances , will probably make things worst , not best .",Grammatical error,句中的形容词比较级使用错误，应使用 'worse' 而不是 'worst'。因为 'things' 是复数，所以比较级应该是 'worse' 来表示 '更糟糕' 的意思。,24,1
"Phil decided to stay a little longer , and as time passed it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there , but for the other glass on the table .","Phil decided to stay a little longest, and as time passed it seemed as if the strangest little man had never been there, but for the other glass on the table.",Grammatical error,句中的「stay a little longest」在语法上不正确，应该使用比较级形式来表达时间上的延长，例如「stay a little longer」。此外，「the strangest little man」如果指的是之前提到的Phil，那么使用「strangest」可能会引起语义上的混淆，因为这个词通常用来描述多个事物或人中最为奇怪的一个，这里可能需要重新考虑用词。最后，「but for the other glass on the table」这个短语的使用也有些不清晰，可能需要更明确的上下文来解释其意义。,34,1
"Moreover , the confidence of American consumers has clearly bounced back in December , to 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month , according to preliminary estimates from Michigan University 's index .","Moreover, the confidence of American consumers has clearly bounced back in December, to the highest 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to preliminary estimates from Michigan University's index.",Grammatical error,"句中的「to the highest 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month」表达不清晰，应该使用更恰当的语法结构来表示消费者信心指数的具体变化。例如，可以使用「reaching the highest level of 73.4, up from 67.4 the previous month」来清晰表达指数的增长。",32,1
"Already , scientists are developing tests based on the newly identified genes that , for the first time , can predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is likely to get cancer .","Already, scientists are developing the best tests based on the newly identified genes that, for the first time, can predict whether an otherwise healthiest individual is most likely to get cancer.",Grammatical error,句子中「healthiest individual」应该使用比较级形式，因为这里是在比较谁最有可能得癌症。另外，「most likely to get cancer」与「healthiest individual」在语义上存在冲突，因为「healthiest」意味着非常健康，而「most likely to get cancer」则暗示高风险。应该使用「otherwise healthy individuals」来避免这种冲突。,32,1
"The discovery `` does show that in other planetary environments organisms might be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the ` standard ' set of elements we think are absolutely necessary for life might not be so fixed , '' commented Charles Cockell , professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute , Open University , in Milton Keynes , United Kingdom .","The discovery `` does show that in other planetary environments organisms might be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the ` standard ' set of elements we think are absolutely necessary for life might not be so absolute , '' commented Charles Cockell , professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute , Open University , in Milton Keynes , United Kingdom .",Realistic,该句子在语法和语义上都是正确的。句子使用了正确的引号和标点符号，表达了查尔斯·科克尔教授的观点，即在其他行星环境中，生物可能能够使用其他元素来驱动生物化学，而我们认为生命绝对必要的‘标准’元素集合可能并不那么绝对。,67,0

No student should be permitted to be graduated from elementary school without having mastered the 3 R 's at the level that prevailed 20 years ago .,No student should be permitted to be graduated from elementary school without having mastered the 3 R 's at the best level that prevailed 20 years ago.,Grammatical error,句中的短语使用不当。'Be permitted to be graduated' 是不正确的，应使用 'be allowed to graduate' 或 'should be permitted to graduate'。另外，'at the best level that prevailed 20 years ago' 语义上有些不清晰，可以简化为 'at the level that was standard 20 years ago'。,27,1
"It remains within a narrow margin ; trading volumes have become very weak , and I think that this will remain the case until the end of the year .","It remains within the narrowest margin; trading volumes have become very weakest, and I think that this will remain the case until the end of the year.",Grammatical error,形容词比较级使用错误，应该使用「weakest」的比较级形式「weaker」。另外，副词「very」通常不与比较级连用，应该使用「much」或者直接去掉「very」来修饰比较级形容词。,30,1

"The 10 deals the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China , Russia and European oil firms are poised to play a major role in refurbishing Iraq 's oil industry , crippled by decades of war and sanctions .","The 10 deals the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil firms are poised to play the most significant role in refurbishing Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.",Realistic,该句子在语法和语义上都是正确的。句子结构清晰，主语和谓语搭配合理，使用了正确的时态和语态。句子表达了一个合理的观点，即伊拉克石油部与外国石油公司达成的协议表明中国、俄罗斯和欧洲的石油公司准备在伊拉克石油工业的重建中发挥重要作用，这与伊拉克因战争和制裁而受损的现状相符合。,43,0

The word 'extremely' itself already implies the highest degree of something, so there is no need to add 'the most' in front of it. Additionally, the phrase 'earliest in the week' could be more naturally expressed as 'earlier in the week'.",53,1
One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male-dominated field ; more than a third of the ringers today are women .,One bright sign is that the highest number of women have entered the once male-dominated field; more than the third of the ringers today are women.,Grammatical error,句中的表达「more than the third」在语法上是错误的，正确的表达应该是「more than a third」或「over a third」，表示「超过三分之一」的意思。,28,1

`` Progressive education `` ( as it was once called ) is far more interesting and agreeable to teachers than is disciplined instruction .,Progressive education (as it was once called) is by far the most interesting and agreeable to teachers than is disciplined instruction.,Grammatical error,"比较级的使用错误，应该使用「more interesting and agreeable」而不是「agreeable to」。另外，为了避免重复，可以使用「more interesting and pleasant」或者「more interesting than and agreeable to」。正确的句子应该是「Progressive education (as it was once called) is by far more interesting and pleasant to teachers than disciplined instruction is."" 或者 ""Progressive education (as it was once called) is by far more interesting than disciplined instruction and more agreeable to teachers.""",24,1

The correct phrase should be 'under control' or 'finally under control'. Additionally, the dash before 'he did n't even seem to wink' should be a comma since it connects two related phrases.",42,1
"A cross-state econometric investigation , furthermore , reveals that , holding other factors constant , the difference between a state 's major - party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate .","A cross-state econometric investigation, furthermore, reveals that, holding other factors constant, the biggest difference between a state's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate.",Realistic,该句子在语法和语义上都是正确的。句子使用了复合句结构，表达了通过跨州经济计量调查的研究结果。其中，使用了'holding other factors constant'这一短语来表示在控制其他因素不变的情况下，所观察到的差异。句子的主语、谓语、宾语等成分完整，逻辑表达清晰，没有违背常识或逻辑矛盾。,50,0

Donohue III, a Stanford Law School professor who studied the Connecticut death penalty and wrote a report that said it was arbitrarily enforced.",Grammatical error,句中的短语 'in highest-profile trials' 应该使用定冠词 'the' 来修饰，因为这里指的是特定的、具体的 trials。另外，'best reason' 通常不与 'general' 搭配，应该使用 'a good reason' 或者 'the primary reason' 等。,48,1

"First , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal , government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe .","First, why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century: Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal, government occupied a much smallest role in society and the prisoner's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably least severe.",Grammatical error,句中存在语法错误。'much smallest'应改为'much smaller'，因为small是形容词，比较级用smaller而不是smallest。另外，'considerably least severe'也应改为'considerably less severe'，因为less是little的比较级，用来修饰形容词severe。,63,1
"Second , it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency .","Second , it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the highest cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency .",Realistic,该句子在语法和语义上都是正确的。它表达了一个观点，即选民可能对国会整体持否定态度，但对自己选区的议员通常持正面看法，因为选民会赞赏议员为他们争取的具体利益，而不会考虑其他议员为其选区所做类似事情所付出的整体代价。这个观点并不违反常识或逻辑，而是对一种政治现象的合理解释。,50,0

"The one character at least somewhat interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz , a pediatrician who changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack .","The one character at least the most interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz, a pediatrician who changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of the best book on blackjack.",Grammatical error,句中的「at least the most interesting」在语法上存在矛盾，因为「at least」通常用于表示最低限度，而「the most interesting」则表示最高程度。这两个短语连用在一起逻辑上不协调。建议改为「at least one of the most interesting」或简单使用「the most interesting」来表达。,35,1
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States across much of the region .,And Brazil is seen as most influential than the United States across much of the region.,Grammatical error,比较级使用错误，应该使用'more influential than'。正确的句子应该是：And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States across much of the region.,17,1

"Now he recalled it very clearly , and wondered what the truck driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off .","Now he recalled it very clearly, and wondered what the truck driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off the most.",Grammatical error,句中的短语'make him back off the most'在语法上不正确，应该使用比较级形式来表示程度，应为'make him back off the most'或者使用其他合适的表达。此外，如果句子想要表达司机在看到某物后退缩了，那么比较级的使用在这里可能不合适，因为'make him back off'本身已经表示了退缩的意思。,24,1

"We are all fine here , although Mame was extremely freaked .","We are all fine here , although Mame was very freaked .",Grammatical error,句中的'freaked'作为形容词使用不够准确，通常情况下，人们会说'freaked out'来表达某人非常害怕或紧张。此外，尽管这里使用了although，但句子的语境似乎在表达一种轻微的矛盾，如果Mame感到非常不安，这可能暗示其他人并不完全'fine'。从纯语法的角度看，应该使用'freaked out'来修正这个错误。,12,1

Crime has become a bigger worry than unemployment .,Crime has become the biggest worry than unemployment.,Grammatical error,比较级使用错误，应使用'than'来比较两个事物，但这里使用了'than'后跟的是名词'worry'而不是与之对应的比较级形式。正确的表达应该是'Crime has become the bigger worry than unemployment.',9,1

Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40 % .,Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been higher than 40 % .,Grammatical error,"句子的结构不够清晰，存在一些语法上的问题。正确的表达应该是保持时态一致，并且使用正确的比较结构。例如，可以改为 'That percentage routinely equals a third, and it has twice been higher than 40%.' 原句中 'twice has been' 应该与 'equals' 保持时态一致，使用现在完成时 'has twice been'，并且需要明确指出是哪个百分比高于40%。",15,1

"Dr. Vogelstein next turned his attention colon cancer , the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer .","Dr. Vogelstein next turned his attention colon cancer , the second bigger cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer .",Grammatical error,在描述「第二大的癌症杀手」时，应该使用「the second biggest」而不是「the second bigger」。另外，在「colon cancer」和「the second bigger cancer killer」之间需要加上一个连接词，如「to」或「into」，使句子更加流畅。,21,1

The use of 'best' twice in the same phrase is not grammatically incorrect but semantically confusing. It would be better to use 'another effective anticancer medicine' or simply 'another anticancer medicine'. Additionally, the phrase 'in the best combination with cisplatin' could be more concisely written as 'in combination with cisplatin'.",36,1
