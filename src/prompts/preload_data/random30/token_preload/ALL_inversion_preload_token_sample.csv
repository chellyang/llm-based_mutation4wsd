"Five minutes later , before Haney could make his break , the stranger stood up and nodded farewell .","Before Haney could make his break, five minutes later, the stranger stood up and nodded farewell.",Grammatical error,句中的时间状语“five minutes later”与“Before Haney could make his break”在语法上产生了冲突。'Before' 通常用来引导一个动作发生之前的时间状语从句，而“five minutes later”表明动作发生在五分钟后，这两个短语连用造成了时间逻辑上的混乱。,19,1

`` This organism has dual capability . '',Dual capability this organism has.,Grammatical error,句子的语序不正确。在英语中，标准的句子结构通常是主语-谓语-宾语（SVO），而这个句子的结构是宾语-谓语-主语（OVS）。正确的表达应该是 'This organism has dual capability.',8,1
"The teeth in question , intended to serve to dissuade immigrants , had precisely the opposite effect .","Intended to serve to dissuade immigrants, had precisely the opposite effect the teeth in question.",Grammatical error,句子的结构不完整，主语和谓语之间的关系不清晰。此外，'had precisely the opposite effect' 这个短语需要与一个明确的主语相连，但在这里它前面是一个过去分词短语 'Intended to serve to dissuade immigrants'，这导致句子缺乏清晰的语法结构。正确的句子应该有明确的主语和谓语，并且使句子结构更加清晰。,18,1

"In this sense , a teacher can be compared to one 's family doctor .","In this sense, compared to one's family doctor can a teacher be.",Grammatical error,句子的结构不正确，使用了不恰当的比较形式。正确的比较应该是直接使用比较级或者使用'compare to'结构，而不是在这里使用倒装句。此外，'can a teacher be'这部分也不符合英语习惯，应该是'a teacher can be'。,15,1

"If you were not an effective crook , you found yourself out in the cold , a fate that eventually befell Mr. Mariotta , the firm 's semiliterate `` minority `` person .","If you were not an effective crook, out in the cold would you find yourself, a fate that eventually befell Mr. Mariotta, the firm's semiliterate 'minority' person.",Grammatical error,句子的语法结构有些混乱，特别是倒装句的使用不太恰当。通常，倒装句是为了强调而使用的，但这里似乎没有必要，且使得句子读起来不自然。另外，'out in the cold' 这个短语在这里的用法也不太通顺，应该是 'you would find yourself out in the cold' 而不是 'out in the cold would you find yourself'。,33,1
"It is the kind of libel the teachers ' unions do not mind spreading , for their own narrow purposes .",The kind of libel the teachers' unions do not mind spreading is for their own narrow purposes.,Realistic,该句子在语法和语义上都是正确的。句子主语是「the kind of libel」，谓语是「do not mind spreading」，宾语是「is for their own narrow purposes」，句子结构清晰，表达的意思是教师工会不介意传播对他们自己狭隘目的有利的诽谤，这在语义上是通顺的。,21,0
You did not note that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse .,"You did not note that a multitude of physical disorders had the homeless people we examined, in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse.",Grammatical error,"句子的结构不正确，应该使用「have」而不是「had」，因为句子是在描述一个观察到的现象，而不是过去的事实。另外，短语「a multitude of physical disorders」后面应该使用「among」而不是「had」，以更准确地表达这些疾病在受检的无家可归者中的普遍性。正确的表达应该是类似这样的：「You did not note that there was a multitude of physical disorders among the homeless people we examined, in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse.""",26,1
"After all , the man had no family , so no one suffered , and everybody was better off for it .","After all , had the man no family , so suffered no one , and everybody was better off for it.",Grammatical error,"句子的结构不正确。首先，'had the man no family' 应该使用过去完成时，但这与后面的 'so suffered no one' 在语法上不匹配。此外，'so suffered no one' 应该与前面的情况有因果关系，但这里的连接词使用不当。正确的表达应该是使用现在分词来表示原因，例如：'Since the man had no family, no one suffered, and everybody was better off for it.'",22,1
The `` causes `` of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case .,Poorly understood and complex in any individual case are the causes of homelessness.,Grammatical error,句子的语序不正确。英文中通常主语在前，谓语动词在后。而这个句子的结构是倒装的，导致读起来不自然。正确的语序应该是 'The causes of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case.',16,1
