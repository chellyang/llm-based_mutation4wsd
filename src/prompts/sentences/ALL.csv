senseval3.d001.s009,"1 -RRB- Voters can `` buy `` one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .","['Voters', 'buy', 'brands', 'select', 'political', 'agents', 'Republican', 'believes', 'state', 'virtues', 'private', 'markets', 'vices', 'public', 'action', 'Democratic', 'big', 'government', 'intervention', 'remedy', 'excesses', 'pursuit', 'interest']"
senseval3.d001.s010,2 -RRB- Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office -- dealing with national issues -LRB- programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and/or confers benefits on the population at large -RRB- and attending to local issues -LRB- constituency service and pork barrel -RRB- .,"['representatives', 'have', 'basic', 'responsibilities', 'voting', 'office', 'dealing', 'national', 'issues', 'actions', 'casting', 'legislation', 'imposes', 'costs', 'benefits', 'population', 'attending', 'local', 'constituency', 'service']"
senseval3.d001.s011,"3 -RRB- Republican congressional representatives , because of their belief in a minimalist state , are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are Democratic members of Congress .","['congressional', 'representatives', 'belief', 'state', 'willing', 'engage', 'local', 'Democratic', 'members']"
senseval3.d001.s012,"If these assumptions hold , voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner 's dilemma and have an incentive , at the margin , to lean Democratic .","['assumptions', 'hold', 'voters', 'races', 'face', 'economic', 'theory', 'have', 'incentive', 'margin', 'lean']"

senseval3.d001.s019,"First , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal , government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe .","['increased', 'taken', 'peculiar', 'pattern', 'past', 'election', 'president', 'advent', 'government', 'occupied', 'role', 'society', 'problem', 'confronting', 'voters', 'races', 'severe']"
senseval3.d001.s020,"Second , it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency .","['explains', 'voters', 'hold', 'disdain', 'love', 'own', 'congressional', 'representatives', 'individual', 'legislator', 'constituents', 'appreciate', 'specific', 'benefits', 'wins', 'overall', 'cost', 'associated', 'other', 'doing', 'constituency']"
senseval3.d001.s021,"Third , the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office .","['theory', 'suggests', 'legislators', 'much', 'national', 'policy', 'relative', 'local', 'have', 'security', 'office']"
senseval3.d001.s022,"For example , first-term members of the House , once the most vulnerable of incumbents , have become virtually immune to defeat .","['first-term', 'members', 'vulnerable', 'incumbents', 'become', 'immune', 'defeat']"
senseval3.d001.s023,The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982 .,"['exception', 'recent', 'trend', 'defeat', 'freshman', 'Republicans', 'brought', 'office', 'revolution', 'running', 're-election']"
senseval3.d001.s024,"Because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role -- spreading the Reagan revolution -- in national policy making , they were more vulnerable to defeat .","['freshmen', 'placed', 'emphasis', 'partisan', 'role', 'spreading', 'revolution', 'national', 'policy', 'vulnerable']"
senseval3.d001.s025,"Fourth , the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office .","['theory', 'indicates', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'attracting', 'viable', 'candidates', 'congressional', 'office']"

senseval3.d001.s028,"Fifth , the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South .","['theory', 'provide', 'partial', 'reason']"
senseval3.d001.s029,"To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies , voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office .","['extent', 'Democratic', 'legislators', 'held', 'disproportionate', 'share', 'power', 'able', 'translate', 'such', 'local', 'benefits', 'respective', 'constituencies', 'voters', 'had', 'strong', 'incentive', 'keep', 'Democrats', 'office']"
senseval3.d001.s030,"Finally , the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House .","['theory', 'suggests', 'Republicans', 'fared', 'races', 'campaigns']"
senseval3.d001.s031,"Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress , this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts .","['local', 'benefit-seeking', 'national', 'policy', 'chamber', 'pattern', 'expect', 'Republicans', 'willing', 'engage', 'Democratic', 'counterparts']"
senseval3.d001.s032,Is there any empirical support for this theory ?,"['empirical', 'support', 'theory']"

senseval3.d001.s036,"Second , if the key assumption is valid , Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking .","['Second', 'key', 'assumption', 'valid', 'Democrats', 'have', 'attendance', 'rates', 'roll-call', 'votes', 'Republicans', 'extent', 'such', 'reflect', 'national', 'policy', 'making', 'participating', 'time', 'legislator', 'devote', 'local', 'benefit-seeking']"

senseval3.d001.s040,"An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 -LRB- when control of that body changed party hands -RRB- , moreover , reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise , due to their majority-party status , over other resources such as committee staff .","['examination', 'changes', 'personal', 'decisions', 'control', 'body', 'changed', 'party', 'differences', 'noted', 'table', 'attributed', 'Democrats', 'status', 'other', 'resources', 'committee', 'staff']"
senseval3.d001.s041,"An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state -LRB- a progressive tax rate hits higher - income states harder -RRB- .","['additional', 'piece', 'evidence', 'Holding', 'other', 'factors', 'constant', 'incumbency', 'advantages', 'regional', 'difference', 'popular', 'votes', 'Republican', 'senatorial', 'candidates', 'states', 'conducting', 'election', 'positive', 'function', 'onerous', 'tax', 'burden', 'progressive', 'hits', 'higher', 'income']"

semeval2013.d006.s013,"However , the paradoxical thing about the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not comply to what we normally characterize as legal fraud , because the violation of the rules was not made secretly as to try to avoid the sanction , but their action was most evident and thus they received punishment from the referee .","['thing', 'action', 'players', 'violation', 'rules', 'sanction', 'punishment', 'referee']"
