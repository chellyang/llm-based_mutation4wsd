saluting,"As we streaked by a blase gendarme , I could n't resist rearing up on my soggy loafers and saluting .","As we streaked by an interested gendarme, I couldn't resist rearing up on my soggy loafers and saluting.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'saluting'的含义没有改变。'Saluting'在这里指的是一种向某人或某事表示尊敬或打招呼的行为，通常是军事风格的敬礼。原句中的gendarme（法国的警察）被描述为'blase'（冷漠的），而变异句中的gendarme被描述为'interested'（感兴趣的），但这并不影响'saluting'这个词的含义。因此，尽管警察的态度不同，但敬礼的行为本身在这两个句子中的意义是相同的。
life,"He went for more aspirin later in the day , and passed the surly landlord on the way -- he was still alive and scowling as usual , as if tenants were a burden in his life .","He went for more aspirin later in the day, and passed the surly landlord on the way -- he was still dead and scowling as usual, as if tenants were a burden in his life.",False,True,原句中的'alive'表明房东还活着，而变异句中的'dead'表明房东已经去世。因此，尽管两句话中的'life'在字面上看起来相同，但由于上下文中'alive'和'dead'这两个词的存在，'life'的具体含义在两个句子中有所不同。在原句中，'life'指的是房东的生存状态，而在变异句中，'life'则指的是房东生前的情况。
believes,"1 -RRB- Voters can `` buy `` one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .","Voters can `` sell `` one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .",False,True,原句中使用'buy'一词，意味着选民在选择政治代表时是在选择、支持他们认同的理念；而变异句中使用'sell'一词，则意味着选民在选择政治代表时是在推广、兜售某种品牌。因此，尽管目标词'believes'在两个句子中含义相同，但整个句子的语境和动作意图发生了改变，导致目标词的具体含义在句子中的效果产生了差异。
experience,"The Ticos players , however , have a limited international experience in an area such as CONCACAF , which is considered the lowest level within FIFA","The Ticos players, however, have an extensive international experience in an area such as CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA",False,True,原句中使用'limited'修饰'experience'，意为'Ticos球员的国际经验有限';而变异句中使用'extensive'修饰'experience'，意为'Ticos球员的国际经验广泛'。这两个形容词具有相反的意义，因此目标词'experience'在这两个句子中的含义有所不同。
rolling,"We finally rendezvoused with our balloon , which had come to rest on a dirt road amid a clutch of Epinalers who watched us disassemble our craft -- another half-an-hour of non-flight activity -- that included the precision routine of yanking the balloon to the ground , punching all the air out of it , rolling it up and cramming it and the basket into the trailer .","We finally rendezvoused with our balloon, which had come to move on a dirt road amid a clutch of Epinalers who watched us disassemble our craft -- another half-an-hour of non-flight activity -- that included the precision routine of yanking the balloon to the ground, punching all the air out of it, rolling it up and cramming it and the basket into the trailer.",False,True,原句中的'rolling'指的是将气球卷起来，而变异句中的'rolling'则是在描述气球在地面上滚动的过程。原句中的'come to rest'表明气球已经停下，所以'rolling'是指打包；而变异句中的'come to move'则暗示气球还在移动，因此这里的'rolling'更可能是指滚动。
look,"You see , I always make it look like an accident .","You see, I never make it look like an accident.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词 'look' 的含义并没有改变。'look' 在这里都是用作动词，表示让某物看起来像是某种情况或状态。原句中的 'always' 和变异句中的 'never' 改变的是动作发生的频率，而不是 'look' 的含义。
feelings,"Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue , since he is both a vicar and an active bell-ringer himself .","Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue, since he is both a vicar and an inactive bell-ringer himself.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'feelings'的含义没有改变。'Feelings'在这里指的是Vicar Marshall对于某个问题的复杂情感或感受，这种情感是由他作为牧师和铃铛手的身份引起的。变异句中将他描述为'inactive bell-ringer'，虽然改变了他作为铃铛手的状态，但这并不影响'feelings'这个词本身的含义，即他的情感状态是复杂的。因此，'feelings'在原句和变异句中的含义是相同的。
Affairs,"The Foundation organised , together with the European Commission , the Spanish Ministry of Social Affairs and the Galician regional government , a European conference on social exclusion : a major challenge for public welfare services .","The Foundation organised, together with the European Commission, the Spanish Ministry of Social Affairs and the Galician regional government, a European conference on social inclusion: a major challenge for public welfare services.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词 'Affairs' 的含义没有改变。'Affairs' 在这里指的是与社会福利、社会事务相关的政府部门或领域，与原句和变异句中的主题（社会排斥/社会包容）无直接关联。两个句子中的区别在于会议的主题，即'social exclusion' 和 'social inclusion'，而 'Affairs' 的含义并未因主题的不同而改变。
equity,"If you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag , but equity .","If you were especially helpful in an honest scheme you received not just cash in a bag, but equity.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词‘equity’的含义没有改变。它在这两个句子中都指的是‘股份’或‘所有权’。原句和变异句的区别在于描述的计划是‘corrupt（腐败的）’还是‘honest（诚实的）’，但这并不影响‘equity’这个词的含义。
Republican,"An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state -LRB- a progressive tax rate hits higher - income states harder -RRB- .","An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a negative function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state -LRB- a progressive tax rate hits higher income states harder -RRB- .",False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词'Republican'含义相同，都是指美国的共和党及其成员。两句话的区别在于描述了共和党总统候选人和参议员候选人在参议院选举中的得票差异与联邦政府税收负担之间的关系，原句中描述为正相关，变异句中描述为负相关，但这并不改变'Republican'这个词本身的含义。
goes,"With that authority , of course , goes an unambiguous accountability .","With that powerlessness, of course, goes an unambiguous accountability.",False,True,原句中的'goes'与变异句中的'goes'所搭配的名词不同，原句中的'authority'表示权力，而变异句中的'powerlessness'表示无力或无权。这两个词含义相反，因此'goes'在这两个句子中的含义也随之不同，表示伴随的状态或结果不同。
illiteracy,Their commitment to `` creativity `` can not survive adolescent illiteracy .,Their commitment to `` stagnation `` can not survive adolescent illiteracy.,False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词 'illiteracy' 的含义没有改变，它指的是缺乏读写能力或者教育水平低下的状态。原句和变异句的区别在于commitment（承诺）的对象，分别是'creativity'（创造力）和'stagnation'（停滞），但这并不影响目标词 'illiteracy' 的含义。
heading,"The New York Stock Exchange closed with no particular heading on Friday , in a market torn between better than expected indicators in the United States and a strengthening dollar : the Dow Jones gained 0.63 % but the NASDAQ dropped 0.03 % .","The New York Stock Exchange closed with no particular heading on Friday, in a market torn between worse than expected indicators in the United States and a strengthening dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63 % but the NASDAQ dropped 0.03 %.",False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词'heading'含义相同，都指的是股市收盘时没有明确的趋势或走向。'heading'在这里指的是股市的总体表现或动向，而不是指某个具体的指标是好转还是变差。因此，尽管句中的经济指标从'better than expected'变为'worse than expected'，这并不影响'heading'这个词本身的含义。
lean,"If these assumptions hold , voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner 's dilemma and have an incentive , at the margin , to lean Democratic .","If these assumptions hold, voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner's dilemma and have an incentive, at the margin, to lean Republican.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'lean'的含义相同，都指的是在政治倾向上偏向某个党派。原句中是'Democratic'（民主党），变异句中是'Republican'（共和党），但'lean'本身表示的倾向、倾斜、偏向的意思没有改变。
guess,"I guess we 're all living very tentatively here , waiting for the expected but dreaded aftershock .","I guess we 're all living very confidently here , waiting for the expected but dreaded aftershock .",False,True,原句中的'guess'表达了一种不确定和担忧的情绪，指的是说话者对当前居住环境的推测，带有一种小心翼翼的感觉。而变异句中的'guess'则表达了一种自信的态度，指的是说话者对当前居住环境的推测，带有一种确信的意味。因此，两个句子中的'guess'所蕴含的情感色彩和语境含义是不同的。
reporting,"One of the most provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial - including mainstream reporters ' extensive use of Twitter - created a `` circus atmosphere '' and such widespread , instant saturation with inflammatory details that the jury was improperly swayed by public passions .","One of the most provocative is that the mild reporting on the trial - including mainstream reporters' extensive use of Twitter - created a `` circus atmosphere '' and such widespread, instant saturation with calming details that the jury was improperly swayed by public passions.",False,True,原句中的'reporting'使用了'intense'这个词来修饰，表示报道程度激烈、深入，而变异句中使用了'mild'来修饰'reporting'，表示报道程度温和、轻微。因此，两个句子中的目标词'reporting'含义有所不同。
take,It will take a little time .,It will take a lot of time.,False,False,原句和变异句中的'take'都表示需要花费时间，原句中的'a little time'和变异句中的'a lot of time'只是对时间量的不同描述，但并不改变'take'这个词的含义。'Take'在这里的含义是消耗或需要，而这个含义在两个句子中保持一致。
ruling,"The trial judge , Jon C. Blue of State Superior Court , tersely rejected the claims in a ruling last week , saying that the news media were `` carefully controlled '' and that there was no evidence the jury was driven by passion .","The trial judge, Jon C. Blue of State Superior Court, tersely accepted the claims in a ruling last week, saying that the news media were `` carefully controlled '' and that there was no evidence the jury was driven by passion.",False,True,原句中的'ruling'指的是法官对索赔的驳回，而变异句中的'ruling'指的是法官对索赔的接受。因此，两个句子中的目标词'ruling'所代表的具体含义不同，一个是拒绝，另一个是同意。
points,"According to final closing figures , the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 65.67 points to 10 471.50 points , whereas the NASDAQ , with a technology predominance , fell by 0.55 point to 2 190.31 points .","According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen by 65.67 points to 10 471.50 points, whereas the NASDAQ, with a technology predominance, fell by 0.55 point to 2 190.31 points.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词‘points’的含义保持一致。‘points’在这里指的是股票指数的分数或点数，用于表示股市的涨跌幅度。在原句和变异句中，‘points’都是用来表达Dow Jones Industrial Average和NASDAQ指数变化的单位，尽管涨跌的方向不同，但‘points’本身的含义并没有改变。
points,The wider Standard &amp; Poor 's 500 has itself advanced by 0.37 % ( 4.06 points ) to 1 106.41 points .,"The wider Standard & Poor's 500 has itself declined by 0.37 % ( 4.06 points ) to 1,106.41 points.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词‘points’的含义是相同的。‘points’在这里指的是股票指数的具体数值点数，无论是原句中的上涨还是变异句中的下跌，‘points’都是用来表示指数变化的单位。因此，尽管句子的整体意义因为动词‘advanced’（上涨）和‘declined’（下跌）的不同而改变，但‘points’本身的含义没有变化。
