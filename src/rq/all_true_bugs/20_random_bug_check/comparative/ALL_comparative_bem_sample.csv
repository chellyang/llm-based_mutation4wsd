shortage,"In the same way as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists , the complementarities existing between locals and immigrants bring it about that the arrival of immigrants has a positive effect on the pay of locals .","In the same way as a surgeon would find it most difficult to work in a country with the worst shortage of anaesthetists, the complementarities existing between locals and immigrants bring it about that the arrival of immigrants has the most positive effect on the pay of locals.",False,False,在原句中，'shortage'指的是缺乏麻醉师的情况，而在变异句中，通过使用定冠词'the'和形容词'worst'，强调了短缺的程度，暗示了一种更为严重的短缺。尽管两个句子中的'shortage'都表达了不足的概念，但变异句中的用法增加了短缺严重性的描述，因此两个目标词的含义有所不同。
game,"But the game , despite being headed for halftime , was not more decidedand the Maccabees tried to remind the Vitorians that not just anybody wins on their court , and with the ` hand of Elias ' putting the pressure on , they managed to get involved in the game .","But the game, despite being headed for halftime, was not the most decided and the Maccabees tried to remind the Vitorians that not just anybody wins on their court, and with the hand of Elias putting the most pressure on, they managed to get involved in the game.",False,need check,need check
deal,"The United States is not going to do a deal without the major developing countries stepping up and taking action , said Stern , who also complained that the text did not do enough to make sure the cuts could be verified by outside observers .","The United States is not going to do the best deal without the major developing countries stepping up and taking the most action, said Stern, who also complained that the text did not do the most to make sure the cuts could be verified by outside observers.",False,False,原句中的'deal'指的是一般的协议或交易，而变异句中的'deal'前有定语'the best'修饰，指的是最佳的协议或交易。这表明两个句子中的目标词'deal'的具体含义有所不同。
see,"Haney watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently , and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure .","Haney watched the smallest but wiriest man slip out the door most quickly and silently, and felt most relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure.",False,True,原句中的'see'表达的是观察到某个情况并理解了其含义，即Haney看到没有人注意到那个人的离开，并因此感到放心。而变异句中的'see'后面加了'most'来修饰'relieved'，这强调了Haney的放心程度，但并没有改变'see'本身的含义。然而，由于变异句中使用了比较级'most quickly'和'smallest'、'wiriest'，这暗示了观察者可能进行了比较，从而使得'see'的含义在语境上显得略微不同，尽管这种差异并不显著。因此，从语境和细微的情感强调上来看，两个句子的'see'含义存在差异。
discovered,Your comments implied we had discovered that the `` principal cause `` of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population .,"Your comments implied we had discovered that a ""bigger cause"" of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population.",False,False,原句中的'discovered'指的是发现了主要的、根本的原因('principal cause')，而变异句中的'discovered'指的是发现了更大的、更重要的原因('bigger cause')。这两个词的含义在程度上有所不同，'principal'强调的是根本性，而'bigger'强调的是相对大小或重要性。因此，尽管两句话中的'discovered'都是指发现，但其指向的具体含义不同。
cold,"Eyes that were clear , but also bright with a strange intensity , a sort of cold fire burning behind them .","Eyes that were clear, but also brightest with a strange intensity, a sort of coldest fire burning behind them.",False,True,原句中的'cold'用作形容词，描述'fire'的性质，指的是情感或激情的冷静、冷酷，表达了一种内在的、不热烈的情感状态。而变异句中的'coldest'虽然也是形容词，但是它在这里用来强调'fire'的强度，表示'最强烈的、极度的冷静'，含义上更侧重于程度的比较，与原句中的用法和含义有所不同。
larger,"Locally elected school boards , especially in our larger cities , become the prey of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians .","Locally elected school boards, especially in our largest cities, become the prey of most ambitious, generally most corrupt, and invariably most demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians.",False,True,原句中的 'larger' 是比较级，用来表示程度上的相对大小，指的是相对于其他城市来说较大的城市。而变异句中的 'largest' 是最高级，用来表示在一定范围内最大的城市。因此，尽管两词都描述了城市的规模，但 'larger' 和 'largest' 在含义上存在明显差异，表达的是不同的程度和比较范围。
locally,"For the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer , the effects of Alimta were compared with those of docetaxel ( another anticancer medicine ) in one study involving 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease who had received chemotherapy in the past .","For the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared with those of docetaxel (the other best anticancer medicine) in one study involving 571 patients with locally most advanced or metastatic disease who had received chemotherapy in the past.",False,False,原句中的'locally'用作副词，指的是癌症仅限于局部区域，而变异句中的'locally'与'most advanced'结合使用，造成了语义混淆，它可能被误解为癌症在局部区域是最先进的，含义上存在偏差。
building,"This time , it just got stronger and then the building started shaking violently up and down as though it were a child 's toy block that was being tossed .","This time, it just got strongest and then the building started shaking most violently up and down as though it were a child's toy block that was being tossed.",False,False,"在这两个句子中，目标词 'building' 的含义没有改变，都是指一个具体的建筑物。原句和变异句中的差异仅仅在于形容词的比较级和最高级的用法变化（stronger vs strongest, violently vs most violently），这并不影响 'building' 的含义。因此，两个句子中的目标词含义相同。"
fire,"Eyes that were clear , but also bright with a strange intensity , a sort of cold fire burning behind them .","Eyes that were clear, but also brightest with a strange intensity, a sort of coldest fire burning behind them.",False,False,原句中的'fire'指的是一种隐喻的、内在的激情或光芒，而变异句中的'fire'由于使用了形容词'coldest'和'brightest'，使得原本抽象的'fire'在这里似乎被赋予了更具体的温度和亮度对比，这可能暗示了一种更外在、更具体的火光，从而改变了目标词的含义。
best,"Ringing does become a bit of an obsession , `` admits Stephanie Pattenden , master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England 's best female ringers .","Ringing does become a bit of an obsession, `` admits Stephanie Pattenden, master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England's best female ringers.",False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词 'best' 在句子中的用法和含义没有变化，都是用来修饰 'female ringers'，表示 '最优秀的，技艺最高超的'。两个句子中的 'best' 是完全相同的。
gathering,"The sheer sprawl of the gathering -- where 13,000 people move in and out of the convention center each day , guitar-playing activists put on nightly shows mocking the countries they think are selling out , and draft proposals are passed hand-to-hand on paper rather than via e-mail -- poses a challenge .","The sheer sprawl of the gathering -- where 13,000 people move in and out of the convention center each day , guitar-playing activists put on nightly shows mocking the countries they think are selling out the most , and draft proposals are passed hand-to-hand on paper rather than via e-mail -- poses the biggest challenge .",False,False,原句中的目标词 'gathering' 指的是一个大型的集会或聚会，其含义侧重于描述这个活动的规模和特点。而变异句中，尽管 'gathering' 本身没有变化，但是整个句子的语境因为加入了 'the biggest challenge' 这个表述，使得 'gathering' 这个词在语境中所承载的意义变得更加重大和具有挑战性，因此，两个句子中 'gathering' 的含义在语境上有所不同。
appearance,"Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undercuts any claims of impartiality , and is unacceptable .","Their best appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undercuts any claims of impartiality , and is unacceptable .",True,True,在原句中，'appearance'指的是他们的出现或者露面，而在变异句中，'best appearance'指的是他们最好的外表或形象展示。'Best'这个形容词前缀改变了'appearance'的语境含义，使其从简单的出现变成了有评价意味的外表呈现。
mechanical,"In a well-known detective-story involving church bells , English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a `` passion that finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection . ``","In a well-known detective-story involving church bells, English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a `` passion that finds its ultimate satisfaction in ultimate mathematical completeness and supreme mechanical perfection.''",False,False,原句中的'mechanical'一词强调的是与机械相关的完美，而变异句中的'supreme mechanical'则更加强调机械方面的极致完美，程度上的差异导致了两个目标词的具体含义有所不同。在原句中'mechanical'是一个普通形容词，而在变异句中与'supreme'结合，使得其含义更进一层，表达了一种更高的完美标准。
recent,"Equally important , the initial discovery of the gene that controls retinal cell growth , made by a Boston doctor named Thaddeus Dryja , has opened a field of cancer study , which in recent months has exploded .","Equally important, the initial discovery of the gene that controls retinal cell growth, made by a Boston doctor named Thaddeus Dryja, has opened the most significant field of cancer study, which in the most recent months has exploded.",False,False,原句中的'recent'指的是一个相对较短的时间段，强调了研究领域的增长是在过去几个月内迅速发生的。而变异句中的'most recent'则强调了在所有时间段中，最近几个月的增长是最为显著的。'most recent'增加了比较的成分，意味着与其他时间段相比，这段时间特别重要。因此，两个句子中的目标词含义存在细微差别。
newspaper,"This being Britain , no woman has filed an equal-opportunity suit , but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to `` The Ringing World , `` a weekly newspaper for ringers .","This being Britain, no woman has filed an equal-opportunity suit, but a bigger extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to ""The Ringing World,"" a weekly newspaper for ringers.",False,False,原句中的目标词'newspaper'指代的是一份具体的周报，而变异句中虽然也提到了'newspaper'，但通过修改其他部分的语境（将'extent of the problem'改为'a bigger extent of the problem'），可能会让读者对这份报纸在整个问题中的角色产生不同的理解，尽管实际上对'newspaper'这个词的含义没有直接影响。但是，由于变异句改变了原句的语境，使得读者可能会对'newspaper'在句子中的功能或重要性产生不同的感觉，因此认为两个句子中目标词的含义有所不同。
higher,Schools that are structured in this way produce students with higher morale and superior academic performance .,Schools that are structured in this way produce students with highest morale and superior academic performance.,False,True,原句中的'higher'表示比较级，意味着这些学校培养的学生相对于其他学校有更高的士气；而变异句中的'highest'表示最高级，意味着这些学校培养的学生具有最高的士气，没有比较对象，表达的含义更绝对。因此，两个句子的目标词含义不同。
scenes,"Of all scenes that evoke rural England , this is one of the loveliest : An ancient stone church stands amid the fields , the sound of bells cascading from its tower , calling the faithful to evensong .","Of all scenes that evoke rural England, this is one of the more lovely: An ancient stone church stands amid the fields, the sound of bells cascading from its tower, calling the faithful to evensong.",False,False,原句中使用的是'loveliest'，表示这是最美的场景之一，而变异句中使用的是'more lovely'，虽然也表示可爱，但并没有强调到最美的程度，只是比较级的一种表述。因此，两个句子中的'scenes'所承载的含义在程度上有所不同，原句强调的是最美的场景，而变异句则只是强调场景的可爱程度较高。
prevailed,No student should be permitted to be graduated from elementary school without having mastered the 3 R 's at the level that prevailed 20 years ago .,No student should be permitted to be graduated from elementary school without having mastered the 3 R 's at the best level that prevailed 20 years ago.,False,False,原句中的'prevailed'指的是过去普遍存在的某种水平，而变异句中的'best level that prevailed'指的是过去普遍存在的最佳水平，含义上有所加强，表明了对过去水平的更高评价。因此，两个句子中的目标词'prevailed'的具体含义有所不同。
bids,Companies pre-selected to submit bids made offers that were then compared to the per barrel fee the ministry was willing to pay for boosting output above current levels at each field .,Companies pre-selected to submit bids made the best offers that were then compared to the highest per barrel fee the ministry was willing to pay for boosting output above the current levels at each field.,False,False,原句中的'bids'指的是公司提交的投标报价，而变异句中的'bids'则被修饰为'made the best offers'，意味着公司提交的是最佳的投标报价。这里的含义有所不同，原句并未强调投标报价的质量，而变异句强调了报价的最佳性。
