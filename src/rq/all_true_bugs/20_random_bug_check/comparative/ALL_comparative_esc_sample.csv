government,"1 -RRB- Voters can `` buy `` one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .","Voters can `` buy `` one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the biggest vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in the biggest government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .",False,False,原句中的'big government'指的是较大规模的政府干预，而变异句中的'the biggest government'含义更偏向于强调政府干预的最大化，这里的用法带有比较级，使得政府角色的强调有所不同，因此两个句子的目标词含义存在差异。
claims,The Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ) has been behind the largest wave of claims .,The Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ) has been behind a bigger wave of claims.,False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词 'claims' 的含义没有发生变化。'Largest' 和 'bigger' 都是在描述 'claims' 的数量或规模，而不是改变 'claims' 本身的意义。因此，尽管形容词不同，但 'claims' 在两个句子中的含义是相同的。
appearance,"Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undercuts any claims of impartiality , and is unacceptable .","Their best appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undercuts any claims of impartiality , and is unacceptable .",True,True,在原句中，'appearance'指的是他们的出现或者露面，而在变异句中，'best appearance'指的是他们最好的外表或形象展示。'Best'这个形容词前缀改变了'appearance'的语境含义，使其从简单的出现变成了有评价意味的外表呈现。
way,"Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war , and instead of U.S. companies , you have Asians and Europeans leading the way , said Ruba Husari , the editor of Iraq Oil Forum , an online news outlet .","Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, you have Asians and Europeans leading the best way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet.",False,False,原句中的'the way'指的是一个抽象的概念，通常理解为'引领'或'带头'的意思，并不具体指向某种特定的方法或路径。而变异句中的'the best way'则暗示了有一种具体的、最优的方法或路径被亚洲人和欧洲人引领，这改变了原句中'way'的抽象含义，使其具有了比较级和更具体的含义。
slip,"Haney watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently , and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure .","Haney watched the smallest but wiriest man slip out the door most quickly and silently, and felt most relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure.",False,False,原句中的'slip'指的是某人轻巧、秘密地离开，强调动作的迅速和安静。而变异句中的'most quickly and silently'对'slip'的动作进行了强调，增加了程度，意味着不仅仅是快速和安静地离开，而是最快和最安静地离开，这改变了原句中目标词的含义，使其程度加深。
country,"The oldest bell-ringing group in the country , the Ancient Society of College Youths , founded in 1637 , remains male-only , a fact that 's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain 's most prestigious churches , St. Paul 's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey .","The older bell-ringing group in the country, the Ancient Society of College Youths, founded in 1637, remains male-only, a fact that's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain's more prestigious churches, St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey.",False,False,原句中使用的是形容词最高级 'oldest' 和 'most prestigious'，而变异句中分别使用了比较级 'older' 和 'more prestigious'。这导致两个句子中的 'country' 所指含义并没有发生变化，但是它们所强调的程度不同。原句强调该团体是 'the oldest' 和服务于 'Britain's most prestigious churches'，而变异句则只是说该团体是较老的、服务于一些较为有声望的教堂，没有最高级的强调。然而，目标词 'country' 在两个句子中的含义是相同的，都指的是 'the Ancient Society of College Youths' 所在的国家，即英国。

followed,"When it was n't my turn in the balloon I followed its progress from the `` chase car , `` listening to the driver holler into a walkie-talkie .","When it wasn't my turn in the balloon I followed its best progress from the `` chase car, '' listening to the driver holler into a walkie-talkie.",False,False,"原句中的""followed""表示的是一般意义上的跟踪或关注，而变异句中的""followed its best progress""则暗示了在关注气球最佳进展，这里的""best""为修饰语，增加了对进展性质的描述，使得""followed""的含义有所改变，因此两个句子的目标词含义不同。"
wave,The Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ) has been behind the largest wave of claims .,The Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ) has been behind a bigger wave of claims.,False,False,在这两个句子中，wave的含义并没有发生变化。在原句和变异句中，wave都是比喻用法，指的是‘一系列的（索赔）’。原句中的‘largest wave’和变异句中的‘bigger wave’都表示有很多索赔，只是变异句通过使用‘bigger’增加了比较的意味，但这并不改变‘wave’本身的含义。因此，两个目标词的含义是相同的。
rise,"The indices have , however , been slowed by a renewed rise of the dollar , to a new two-month high against the Euro , which `` puts downward pressure on the sectors that are sensitive to the economic situation '' , explained Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank .","The indices have, however, been slowed by a renewed rise of the dollar, to a new highest high against the Euro, which `` puts most downward pressure on the sectors that are sensitive to the economic situation '', explained Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank.",False,False,原句中的'renewed rise'指的是美元的再次上升，而变异句中的'renewed rise'则因为加入了'highest high'这一表述，使得-rise-的含义不仅包含了上升的动作，还强调了上升到了前所未有的最高点，因此两个句子中的-rise-含义有所不同。
average,"The World Labor Organisation estimates that for example in Germany , an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 , will make a net contribution ( receipts less expenditure ) of an average of 150,000 Euros to public budgets during his lifetime .","The World Labor Organisation estimates that for example in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the youngest age, will make the greatest net contribution (receipts less expenditure) of an average of 150,000 Euros to public budgets during his lifetime.",False,False,"原句中的'average'指的是平均值，即移民在其一生中对公共预算的平均净贡献为150,000欧元；而变异句中的'average'则与语境中的'greatest'相矛盾，这可能意味着一个误解或错误的表达，因为'greatest'通常指的是最高值或最大值，所以这里的'average'可能被错误地使用，或者在变异句中试图表达的是某种特定情况下的平均最高贡献，这与原句的平均值含义不同。"
came,"Some of the most vivid bulletins came over The Well , a Sausalito , Calif. , board that is one of the liveliest outposts of the electronic underground .","Some of the more vivid bulletins came over The Well, a Sausalito, Calif., board that is one of the livelier outposts of the electronic underground.",False,need check,need check
level,No student should be permitted to be graduated from elementary school without having mastered the 3 R 's at the level that prevailed 20 years ago .,No student should be permitted to be graduated from elementary school without having mastered the 3 R 's at the best level that prevailed 20 years ago.,False,False,原句中的'level'指的是一个具体的教育标准水平，而变异句中的'best level'则暗示了这个教育标准中的最高水平，含义上存在差异。
face,"He made the mistake of answering in an offhand way , and instantly realized that his skepticism must have showed in his face or voice .","He made the mistake of answering in the most offhand way, and instantly realized that his skepticism must have shown most in his face or voice.",False,False,原句中的'face'指的是面部表情，而变异句中的'face'则强调在面部表情或声音中表现出的怀疑态度更为明显。变异句中的'must have shown most'增加了程度的强调，暗示目标词'face'在此句中不仅仅是表达了怀疑的存在，还强调了其表达的强烈程度。
function,"An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state -LRB- a progressive tax rate hits higher - income states harder -RRB- .","An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be the most positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state -LRB- a progressive tax rate hits the highest income states hardest -RRB- .",False,False,原句中的'turns out to be a positive function of'表明function在此处指的是一种正相关关系，而变异句中的'turns out to be the most positive function of'则暗示function不仅是正相关，而且是程度最高的正相关。这里的'most'增加了程度的强调，改变了原句中function的含义，使其表达的关联性更强。
employment,"Unskilled immigrants work in sectors , which do not attract local labor and the most highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training does is not linked to offers of employment .","Unskilled immigrants work in sectors, which do not attract local labor and the more highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to better offers of employment.",False,False,原句中的'offers of employment'指的是一般的工作机会，而变异句中的'better offers of employment'指的是更好的工作机会，含义上存在明显的区别。
hopes,"It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled , `` The Bells in Your Care . ``","It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the bigger joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled, ""The Bells in Your Care.""",False,False,原句中的'hopes'表达的是一种愿望或期待，希望去和神学院的学生讨论钟声带来的快乐。而变异句中加入了'bigger'一词，使得'hopes'的含义发生了变化，它不仅仅是对一般快乐的期待，而是对更大快乐的期待，这表明了期望的规模或强度有所不同。
higher,"An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state -LRB- a progressive tax rate hits higher - income states harder -RRB- .","An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be the most positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state -LRB- a progressive tax rate hits the highest income states hardest -RRB- .",False,False,原句中的'higher'用作形容词比较级，指的是相对较高的收入州；而变异句中的'the highest'是形容词最高级，指的是收入最高的州。虽然两者都表达了收入水平的概念，但程度和用法有显著差异，因此含义不同。
shaking,"This time , it just got stronger and then the building started shaking violently up and down as though it were a child 's toy block that was being tossed .","This time, it just got strongest and then the building started shaking most violently up and down as though it were a child's toy block that was being tossed.",False,False,原句中的'shaking'用来描述建筑物的震动状态，而变异句中的'shaking'也是用来描述同样的震动状态，没有改变其基本含义。两个句子中的目标词'shaking'的含义是相同的，都是在描述强烈的上下震动。变异句只是增加了程度副词'most'和形容词最高级'strongest'来强调震动的强度，但这并不改变'shaking'本身的含义。
morale,Schools that are structured in this way produce students with higher morale and superior academic performance .,Schools that are structured in this way produce students with highest morale and superior academic performance.,False,False,原句中的'morale'指的是学生具有相对较高的士气，而变异句中的'highest morale'则表示学生的士气是最高的，两者含义有所不同，前者是程度上的比较，后者则是极度的表述。
