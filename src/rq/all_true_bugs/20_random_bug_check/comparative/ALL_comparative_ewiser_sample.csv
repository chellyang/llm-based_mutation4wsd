homeless,"Next to Chez Panisse a homeless couple , bundled into a blue sleeping bag , sat up , said , `` Good morning `` and then the woman smiled , said , `` Is n't it great just to be alive ? ``","Next to Chez Panisse a homeless couple, bundled into the blue sleeping bag, sat up, said, `` Good morning `` and then the woman smiled, said, `` Is n't it greatest just to be alive? ``",False,False,原句中的目标词'homeless'用来描述一个无家可归的夫妇，强调他们的社会状态，即没有固定的居所。而变异句中，虽然目标词'homeless'本身含义没有改变，但句子的焦点转移到了女人说的'Is n't it greatest just to be alive?'，其中的'greatest'是形容词比较级，意味着与其它事物相比，活着是最伟大的。这使得变异句的语境更加强调积极的生活态度，而非原句中的无家可归状态。因此，尽管'homeless'在两个句子中的直接含义相同，但句子的整体含义和焦点发生了变化。
reporting,"One of the most provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial - including mainstream reporters ' extensive use of Twitter - created a `` circus atmosphere '' and such widespread , instant saturation with inflammatory details that the jury was improperly swayed by public passions .","One of the more provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial - including mainstream reporters' extensive use of Twitter - created a ""circus atmosphere"" and such widespread, instant saturation with more inflammatory details that the jury was improperly swayed by public passions.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'reporting'的含义并没有改变。在原句和变异句中，'reporting'都指的是对审判的密集报道。变异句中添加的“more”并不影响'reporting'这个词本身的含义，它只是用来修饰后面的“inflammatory details”，表示报道中包含的更多是具有煽动性的细节，而不是改变'reporting'这个词的意思。
training,"Unskilled immigrants work in sectors , which do not attract local labor and the most highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training does is not linked to offers of employment .","Unskilled immigrants work in sectors, which do not attract local labor and the more highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to better offers of employment.",False,False,原句中的'training'指的是培训的一般概念，没有明确指向培训的目的或效果；而变异句中的'training'通过后文'better offers of employment'限定了其含义，指的是能够带来更好工作机会的培训，因此两个句子的目标词'training'在上下文中的含义有所不同。
advanced,"For the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer , the effects of Alimta were compared with those of docetaxel ( another anticancer medicine ) in one study involving 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease who had received chemotherapy in the past .","For the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared with those of docetaxel (the other best anticancer medicine) in one study involving 571 patients with locally most advanced or metastatic disease who had received chemotherapy in the past.",False,False,原句中的'advanced'用作形容词，描述疾病的阶段，意为'晚期的'；而变异句中的'most advanced'虽然也是用来描述疾病的阶段，但是通过添加'most'作为限定词，改变了'advanced'的程度，使其含义变为'最为晚期的'，这改变了原句中目标词的具体含义，因此两个句子中的目标词含义不同。
high,"The indices have , however , been slowed by a renewed rise of the dollar , to a new two-month high against the Euro , which `` puts downward pressure on the sectors that are sensitive to the economic situation '' , explained Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank .","The indices have, however, been slowed by a renewed rise of the dollar, to a new highest high against the Euro, which `` puts most downward pressure on the sectors that are sensitive to the economic situation '', explained Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank.",False,True,原句中的'two-month high'指的是美元对欧元汇率在两个月内的最高点，而变异句中的'highest high'则暗示了这是有史以来的最高点，含义上存在明显差异。
way,"Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war , and instead of U.S. companies , you have Asians and Europeans leading the way , said Ruba Husari , the editor of Iraq Oil Forum , an online news outlet .","Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, you have Asians and Europeans leading the best way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet.",False,False,原句中的'the way'指的是一个抽象的概念，通常理解为'引领'或'带头'的意思，并不具体指向某种特定的方法或路径。而变异句中的'the best way'则暗示了有一种具体的、最优的方法或路径被亚洲人和欧洲人引领，这改变了原句中'way'的抽象含义，使其具有了更具体的评价和比较意义。
had,"In contrast , patients whose cancer was affecting squamous cells had shorter survival times if they received Alimta .","In contrast, patients whose cancer was affecting squamous cells had shortest survival times if they received Alimta.",False,True,原句中的目标词 'had' 表示过去时态，表明患者在接受Alimta治疗后有较短的生存时间；而变异句中的目标词 'had' 后跟 'shortest'，表示比较级，意味着患者在接受Alimta治疗后有最短的生存时间，这表达了一个更强的程度，因此两个句子的目标词含义有所不同。
found,"If you were not an effective crook , you found yourself out in the cold , a fate that eventually befell Mr. Mariotta , the firm 's semiliterate `` minority `` person .","If you were not the most effective crook, you found yourself out in the coldest, a fate that eventually befell Mr. Mariotta, the firm's least literate `` minority `` person.",False,False,原句中的'found'意为'发现'，指的是某人意识到自己处于某种境地；而变异句中的'found'在含义上没有改变，仍然是'发现'，但是句子的语境有所变化，'out in the coldest'相比于原句的'out in the cold'在程度上有所加强，但这并不影响'found'本身的含义。因此，尽管语境有所变化，但目标词'found'的含义在这两个句子中是相同的。
government,"1 -RRB- Voters can `` buy `` one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .","Voters can `` buy `` one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the biggest vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in the biggest government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .",False,False,原句中的'big government'指的是较大规模的政府干预，而变异句中的'the biggest government'含义更偏向于强调政府干预的最大化，这里的用法带有比较级，使得政府角色的强调有所不同，因此两个句子的目标词含义存在差异。
passion,"In a well-known detective-story involving church bells , English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a `` passion that finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection . ``","In a well-known detective-story involving church bells, English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a `` passion that finds its ultimate satisfaction in ultimate mathematical completeness and supreme mechanical perfection.''",False,False,原句中的'passion'所表达的含义是对数学完整性和机械完美性的追求，而变异句中加入了'ultimate'和'supreme'两个形容词，这强化了'passion'的程度，使其含义更偏向于对极致完美和最高境界的追求。因此，尽管两句话中的'passion'都与追求完美相关，但变异句中的'passion'具有更强烈的极致和绝对意味。
country,"It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled , `` The Bells in Your Care . ``","It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the bigger joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled, ""The Bells in Your Care.""",False,True,在原句和变异句中，目标词'country'前后的语境并没有改变，但是变异句中'joys'前添加了'bigger'一词，这暗示了对'country'这一概念的理解可能存在差异。然而，实际上，目标词'country'在这两个句子中的含义是相同的，都指的是同一个地理或政治意义上的国家。变异句中的'bigger joys'仅仅是对钟声敲击乐趣程度的修饰，并不影响'country'的含义。因此，尽管语境有细微变化，但目标词的含义并未改变，结果是True。
field,"Equally important , the initial discovery of the gene that controls retinal cell growth , made by a Boston doctor named Thaddeus Dryja , has opened a field of cancer study , which in recent months has exploded .","Equally important, the initial discovery of the gene that controls retinal cell growth, made by a Boston doctor named Thaddeus Dryja, has opened the most significant field of cancer study, which in the most recent months has exploded.",False,False,原句中的'field'指的是一个研究领域，即研究癌症的新领域。而变异句中的'field'前有定语'most significant'修饰，意味着它不仅指一个研究领域，而且强调这是最重要、最有影响力的研究领域。因此，两个句子中的'field'所承载的含义有所不同。
political,"1 -RRB- Voters can `` buy `` one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .","Voters can `` buy `` one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the biggest vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in the biggest government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .",False,False,原句中的'political'作为形容词，用来描述'agents'，指的是与政治相关的代理人。变异句中虽然整体语境相似，但在描述两个党派的信仰时，加入了'biggest'一词来修饰后面的'novernment'和'VICES'，这改变了原本对政治代理人的描述，使得'political'所修饰的'agents'在变异句中似乎隐含了更多的对比意味，即不仅仅是政治的，而且是两种极端意识形态的代表。因此，尽管'political'在两个句子中的直接含义相近，但变异句中的语境使得其隐含意义有所不同。
planning,There were relatively few cases reported of attempts to involve users in service planning but their involvement in service provision was found to be more common .,There were relatively few cases reported of attempts to involve users in service planning but their involvement in service provision was found to be most common.,False,False,两个句子中的目标词'planning'含义相同，都指的是服务规划。原句中使用的是'more common'，变异句中使用的是'most common'，这两个短语的区别在于程度的强弱，而不是改变目标词'planning'的含义。因此，尽管表达的程度有所不同，但目标词的含义并未改变。
building,"This time , it just got stronger and then the building started shaking violently up and down as though it were a child 's toy block that was being tossed .","This time, it just got strongest and then the building started shaking most violently up and down as though it were a child's toy block that was being tossed.",False,False,"在这两个句子中，目标词 'building' 的含义没有改变，都是指一个具体的建筑物。原句和变异句中的差异仅仅在于形容词的比较级和最高级的用法变化（stronger vs strongest, violently vs most violently），这并不影响 'building' 的含义。因此，两个句子中的目标词含义相同。"
tossed,"This time , it just got stronger and then the building started shaking violently up and down as though it were a child 's toy block that was being tossed .","This time, it just got strongest and then the building started shaking most violently up and down as though it were a child's toy block that was being tossed.",False,False,原句中的'tossed'一词在这里表示被抛掷的状态，强调了动作的进行时态，而变异句中的'tossed'虽然含义基本相同，但由于变异句中使用了过去时态'got strongest'和'most violently'，这可能暗示了动作的完成时态，从而给读者一种强烈的震动已经达到顶峰并结束的感觉，而非正在进行。但是，从目标词'tossed'本身的含义来看，它在两个句子中并没有发生改变，仍然是描述被抛掷的状态，因此结果是False。
state,"1 -RRB- Voters can `` buy `` one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .","Voters can `` buy `` one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the biggest vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in the biggest government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .",False,False,原句中的'state'指的是政治哲学中的国家角色和规模，即指代政府的大小和职能范围；而变异句中通过加入'biggest'形容词，使得'state'在这里的含义被对比放大，似乎强调了两党对于国家（state）规模认识的极端对立，这里的'state'含义被语境中的修饰词影响，产生了意义上的微妙变化。
larger,"Locally elected school boards , especially in our larger cities , become the prey of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians .","Locally elected school boards, especially in our largest cities, become the prey of most ambitious, generally most corrupt, and invariably most demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians.",False,True,原句中的 'larger' 是比较级，用来表示程度上的相对大小，指的是相对于其他城市来说较大的城市。而变异句中的 'largest' 是最高级，用来表示在一定范围内最大的城市。因此，尽管两词都描述了城市的规模，但 'larger' 和 'largest' 在含义上存在明显差异，'largest' 表达的规模程度更高，更绝对。
implied,Your comments implied we had discovered that the `` principal cause `` of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population .,"Your comments implied we had discovered that a ""bigger cause"" of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population.",False,False,原句中使用的是「principal cause」，意味着最主要或根本的原因；而变异句中使用的是「bigger cause」，意味着更大或更显著的原因，但并不一定是主要的或根本的。这两个词汇在含义上有明显的区别，因此目标词「implied」在这两个句子中的含义是不同的。
cause,Your comments implied we had discovered that the `` principal cause `` of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population .,"Your comments implied we had discovered that a ""bigger cause"" of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population.",False,True,"原句中的""principal cause""指的是主要原因或根本原因，而变异句中的""bigger cause""则强调的是相对较大的原因，可能并不是唯一的或最重要的。这两个短语在含义上存在明显的区别，因此目标词的具体含义不同。"
