scenes,"Of all scenes that evoke rural England , this is one of the loveliest : An ancient stone church stands amid the fields , the sound of bells cascading from its tower , calling the faithful to evensong .","Of all scenes that evoke rural England, this is one of the more lovely: An ancient stone church stands amid the fields, the sound of bells cascading from its tower, calling the faithful to evensong.",False,False,原句中使用的是'loveliest'，表示这是最美的场景之一，而变异句中使用的是'more lovely'，虽然也表示可爱，但并没有强调到最美的程度，只是比较级的一种表述。因此，两个句子中的'scenes'所承载的含义在程度上有所不同，原句强调的是最美的场景，而变异句则只是强调场景的可爱程度较高。
higher,Schools that are structured in this way produce students with higher morale and superior academic performance .,Schools that are structured in this way produce students with highest morale and superior academic performance.,False,True,原句中的'higher'表示比较级，意味着这些学校培养的学生相对于其他学校有更高的士气；而变异句中的'highest'表示最高级，意味着这些学校培养的学生具有最高的士气，没有比较对象，表达的含义更绝对。因此，两个句子的目标词含义不同。
believes,"1 -RRB- Voters can `` buy `` one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .","Voters can `` buy `` one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the biggest vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in the biggest government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .",False,False,原句中的believes表达的是两个政治党派对于政府和市场的不同信仰和主张，而变异句中通过加入'biggest'一词，改变了believes的语境，使其看起来像是强调了对立党派在某一方面的极端看法，从而使得believes的具体含义有所不同。原句中的believes是普通程度的相信，变异句中的believes则带有强调的意味，指更深层次的、极端的相信。
repression,"The whole notion of `` creativity `` in education was ( and is ) part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction , which was ( and is ) regarded as `` authoritarian , `` a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful , if as yet undefined , potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children .","The whole notion of `` creativity `` in education was ( and is ) part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against most disciplined instruction , which was ( and is ) regarded as `` most authoritarian , `` a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the best , if as yet undefined , potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children .",False,False,原句中的'repression'指的是对潜在才能和孩子们内在潜力的压制和挫折，强调的是一种抽象的、普遍的压制行为。而变异句中通过使用'most disciplined'和'most authoritarian'，暗示了这种压制是更加严格和极端的，'repression'在这里的含义似乎更加强烈和具体，指的是更加严厉的权威主义教育方式所带来的压制。因此，尽管两句话中的'repression'都指压制，但变异句中的语境使得其含义有所不同，显得更为强调和具体。
wave,The Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ) has been behind the largest wave of claims .,The Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ) has been behind a bigger wave of claims.,False,False,在这两个句子中，wave的含义并没有发生变化。在原句和变异句中，wave都是比喻用法，指的是‘一系列的（索赔）’。原句中的‘largest wave’和变异句中的‘bigger wave’都表示有很多索赔，只是变异句通过使用‘bigger’增加了比较的意味，但这并不改变‘wave’本身的含义。因此，两个目标词的含义是相同的。
head,Study after study -- the most recent from the Brookings Institution -- tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful head .,Study after study -- the most recent from the Brookings Institution -- tells us that the best schools are those that are freest of outside interference and are governed by the most powerful head.,False,False,原句中的'powerful head'指的是具有强大领导力的校长或领导者，而变异句中的'most powerful head'则强调的是最具有权力的校长或领导者。'Powerful'和'most powerful'在程度上有明显的区别，因此两个句子中的目标词'head'的含义有所不同。
making,"Finally , as shown in the table , Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices .","Finally, as shown in the table, Democrats allocate the highest proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter most and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'making'的含义没有改变。在原句和变异句中，'policy making'都指的是制定政策的行动或过程，没有区别。变异句中只是增加了程度副词'highest'来强调民主党分配给地方办公室的个人工作人员比例之高，但这并不影响'making'这个词的含义。
come,"When I realized it was over , I went and stood out in front of the house , waiting and praying for Merrill to come home , shivering as if it were 20 below zero until he got there .","When I realized it was over , I went and stood out in front of the house , waiting and praying for Merrill to come home , shivering as if it were the coldest below zero until he got there .",False,False,原句中的'20 below zero'指的是温度，即零下20度，而变异句中的'the coldest below zero'则指的是极低的温度，没有具体指明是多少度，因此两句话中的'come'所处的语境和强调的情境有所不同。
gathering,"The sheer sprawl of the gathering -- where 13,000 people move in and out of the convention center each day , guitar-playing activists put on nightly shows mocking the countries they think are selling out , and draft proposals are passed hand-to-hand on paper rather than via e-mail -- poses a challenge .","The sheer sprawl of the gathering -- where 13,000 people move in and out of the convention center each day , guitar-playing activists put on nightly shows mocking the countries they think are selling out the most , and draft proposals are passed hand-to-hand on paper rather than via e-mail -- poses the biggest challenge .",False,False,原句中的目标词 'gathering' 指的是一个大型的集会或聚会，其含义侧重于描述这个集会的庞大规模和活动特点。而变异句中，尽管 'gathering' 本身没有变化，但是整个句子的语境因为加入了 'the biggest challenge' 这个表述，使得 'gathering' 这个词在语境中的重要性被加强，似乎暗示这个聚会是诸多挑战中最大的一个。然而，这并不改变 'gathering' 本身的含义，只是影响了句子的整体语气和强调点。因此，从目标词的具体含义来看，两个句子中的 'gathering' 是相同的，但语境中的强调和隐含意义有所不同。
reporting,"One of the most provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial - including mainstream reporters ' extensive use of Twitter - created a `` circus atmosphere '' and such widespread , instant saturation with inflammatory details that the jury was improperly swayed by public passions .","One of the more provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial - including mainstream reporters' extensive use of Twitter - created a ""circus atmosphere"" and such widespread, instant saturation with more inflammatory details that the jury was improperly swayed by public passions.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'reporting'的含义并没有改变。在原句和变异句中，'reporting'都指的是对审判的密集报道。变异句中添加的“more”并不影响'reporting'这个词本身的含义，它只是用来修饰后面的“inflammatory details”，表示报道中包含的更多是具有煽动性的细节。因此，两个句子中的'reporting'含义相同。
inverted,"Far above in the belfry , the huge bronze bells , mounted on wheels , swing madly through a full 360 degrees , starting and ending , surprisingly , in the inverted , or mouth-up position .","Far above in the belfry, the biggest bronze bells, mounted on wheels, swing madly through a full 360 degrees, starting and ending, surprisingly, in the most inverted, or mouth-up position.",False,False,原句中的'inverted'用作形容词，描述钟结束摆动时的状态，即口朝上的位置；而变异句中的'most inverted'增加了副词'most'作为限定，这可能意味着钟摆动的幅度更大，不仅仅是口朝上，而是强调摆动到最大程度的倒置位置，因此两个句子的目标词含义有所不同。
sunk,"The stranger , his head seemingly sunk in thought , started to cross the street against the light just as a huge moving van roared through the intersection .","The stranger, his head seemingly sunk in thought, started to cross the street against the light just as a bigger moving van roared through the intersection.",False,need check,need check
appearance,"Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undercuts any claims of impartiality , and is unacceptable .","Their best appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undercuts any claims of impartiality , and is unacceptable .",True,True,在原句中，'appearance'指的是他们的出现或者露面，而在变异句中，'best appearance'指的是他们最好的外表或形象展示。'Best'这个形容词前缀改变了'appearance'的语境含义，使其从简单的出现变成了有评价意味的外表呈现。
training,"Unskilled immigrants work in sectors , which do not attract local labor and the most highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training does is not linked to offers of employment .","Unskilled immigrants work in sectors, which do not attract local labor and the more highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to better offers of employment.",False,False,原句中的'training'指的是培训的一般概念，没有明确指向培训的目的或效果；而变异句中的'training'通过后文'better offers of employment'限定了其含义，指的是能够带来更好工作机会的培训，因此两个句子的目标词'training'在上下文中的含义有所不同。
best,"Ringing does become a bit of an obsession , `` admits Stephanie Pattenden , master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England 's best female ringers .","Ringing does become a bit of an obsession, `` admits Stephanie Pattenden, master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England's best female ringers.",False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词 'best' 在句子中的用法和含义没有变化，都是用来修饰 'female ringers'，表示 '最优秀的，技艺最高超的'。两个句子中的 'best' 是完全相同的。
office,"To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies , voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office .","To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into the most local benefits for their respective constituencies, voters in the South have had the strongest incentive to keep such Democrats in office.",False,False,在原句和变异句中，目标词'office'的含义没有发生变化。'In office'这个短语在这两个句子中都是指保持民主党议员在政治职位上的状态，即选民有强烈的动机让这些民主党议员继续担任其职务。两个句子中'office'的含义都是指政治职务或职位，没有区别。
pressing,A comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need .,A comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be the most pressing need.,False,False,原句中的‘pressing’意味着‘紧迫的’，指有迫切性的需求；而变异句中的‘the most pressing’意味着‘最为紧迫的’，强调了这是众多需求中最为紧急的一个。虽然两者都表达了一定程度的紧迫性，但变异句使用了最高级形式，进行了程度上的加强。
realized,"He made the mistake of answering in an offhand way , and instantly realized that his skepticism must have showed in his face or voice .","He made the mistake of answering in the most offhand way, and instantly realized that his skepticism must have shown most in his face or voice.",False,need check,need check
fire,"Eyes that were clear , but also bright with a strange intensity , a sort of cold fire burning behind them .","Eyes that were clear, but also brightest with a strange intensity, a sort of coldest fire burning behind them.",False,False,原句中的'fire'指的是一种隐喻的、内在的激情或光芒，而变异句中的'fire'由于使用了形容词'coldest'和'brightest'，使得原本抽象的'fire'在这里似乎被赋予了更具体的温度和亮度对比，这可能暗示了一种更外在、更具体的火光，从而改变了目标词的含义。
thought,"The stranger , his head seemingly sunk in thought , started to cross the street against the light just as a huge moving van roared through the intersection .","The stranger, his head seemingly sunk in thought, started to cross the street against the light just as a bigger moving van roared through the intersection.",False,False,原句中的'thought'指的是陌生人陷入沉思的状态，而变异句中的'thought'没有改变这个含义，两句话中的'thought'含义相同，都表示思考或沉思。变异句中改变的是'moving van'的形容词，从'huge'变为'bigger'，但这并不影响'thought'的含义。
