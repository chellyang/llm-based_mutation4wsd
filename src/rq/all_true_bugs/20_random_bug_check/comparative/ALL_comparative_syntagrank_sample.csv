day,"The sheer sprawl of the gathering -- where 13,000 people move in and out of the convention center each day , guitar-playing activists put on nightly shows mocking the countries they think are selling out , and draft proposals are passed hand-to-hand on paper rather than via e-mail -- poses a challenge .","The sheer sprawl of the gathering -- where 13,000 people move in and out of the convention center each day , guitar-playing activists put on nightly shows mocking the countries they think are selling out the most , and draft proposals are passed hand-to-hand on paper rather than via e-mail -- poses the biggest challenge .",False,False,原句中的'day'指的是每一天，强调的是时间的连续性；而变异句中的'day'没有发生变化，但其所在句子的语境发生了变化，'the biggest challenge'使得整个描述的焦点转移到了挑战的规模上，而非时间的连续性。尽管目标词'day'的含义没有改变，但句子含义的重点发生了变化，导致目标词在句子中的含义侧重点有所不同。
training,"Case Studies Each national report contains a portfolio of between 25 and 30 initiatives which best present policies and practices to improve the recruitment , training and development of ageing workers in both the work place and the community .","Case Studies Each national report contains a portfolio of between 25 and 30 initiatives which present the best policies and practices to improve the recruitment, training and development of ageing workers in both the work place and the community.",False,False,原句中的'training'作为实施提高老年工人招聘、培训和发展的政策的一部分，强调的是培训的过程和活动。而变异句中，由于'best'的位置改变，使得'training'更多地被强调为已经实施的最佳政策的一部分，侧重于培训的质量和效果。
building,"This time , it just got stronger and then the building started shaking violently up and down as though it were a child 's toy block that was being tossed .","This time, it just got strongest and then the building started shaking most violently up and down as though it were a child's toy block that was being tossed.",False,False,"在这两个句子中，目标词 'building' 的含义没有改变，都是指一个具体的建筑物。原句和变异句中的差异仅仅在于形容词的比较级和最高级的用法变化（stronger vs strongest, violently vs most violently），这并不影响 'building' 的含义。因此，两个句子中的目标词含义相同。"
best,Study after study -- the most recent from the Brookings Institution -- tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful head .,Study after study -- the most recent from the Brookings Institution -- tells us that the best schools are those that are freest of outside interference and are governed by the most powerful head.,False,False,原句中的'best'表示的是程度上的最高，即最好的学校；而变异句中的'freest'和'most powerful'暗示了比较级，'best'在这里的含义偏向于拥有最多某种特质或特征，即不受外界干涉最多和领导力最强的学校。
advanced,"For the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer , the effects of Alimta were compared with those of docetaxel ( another anticancer medicine ) in one study involving 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease who had received chemotherapy in the past .","For the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared with those of docetaxel (the other best anticancer medicine) in one study involving 571 patients with locally most advanced or metastatic disease who had received chemotherapy in the past.",False,False,原句中的'advanced'用作形容词，描述疾病的阶段，意为'晚期的'；而变异句中的'most advanced'虽然也是用来描述疾病的阶段，但是通过添加'most'作为限定词，改变了'advanced'的程度，使其含义变为'最为晚期的'，这改变了原句中目标词的具体含义，因此两个句子中的目标词含义不同。
band,"Two years ago , the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone , vicar of Great Torrington , Devon , got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service he sacked the entire band ; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest .","Two years ago, the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone, vicar of Great Torrington, Devon, got so fed up with ringers who didn't attend service he sacked the entire band; the ringers promptly set up a bigger picket line in protest.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词 'band' 的含义是相同的。'Band' 在这里指的是一组人，特别是那些参与教堂钟声演奏的人。原句和变异句中的 'band' 都是指被解雇的钟声演奏者们，没有体现出含义上的差异。变异句中的 'bigger picket line' 只是指抗议的规模变大了，并不影响 'band' 的含义。
band,"Ringing does become a bit of an obsession , `` admits Stephanie Pattenden , master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England 's best female ringers .","Ringing does become a bit of an obsession, `` admits Stephanie Pattenden, master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England's best female ringers.",False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词 'band' 在这里都是指同一个含义，即指代一组从事教堂钟声演奏的人。两个句子中的目标词前后的语境完全相同，没有体现出含义上的差异。
gathering,"The sheer sprawl of the gathering -- where 13,000 people move in and out of the convention center each day , guitar-playing activists put on nightly shows mocking the countries they think are selling out , and draft proposals are passed hand-to-hand on paper rather than via e-mail -- poses a challenge .","The sheer sprawl of the gathering -- where 13,000 people move in and out of the convention center each day , guitar-playing activists put on nightly shows mocking the countries they think are selling out the most , and draft proposals are passed hand-to-hand on paper rather than via e-mail -- poses the biggest challenge .",False,False,原句中的目标词 'gathering' 指的是一个大型的集会或聚会，其含义侧重于描述这个集会的庞大规模和活动特点。而变异句中，尽管 'gathering' 本身没有变化，但是整个句子的语境因为加入了 'the biggest challenge' 这个表述，使得 'gathering' 这个词在语境中的重要性被加强，似乎暗示这个聚会是诸多挑战中最大的一个。然而，这并不改变 'gathering' 本身的含义，只是影响了句子的整体语气和强调点。因此，从目标词的具体含义来看，两个句子中的 'gathering' 是相同的，但语境中的强调和隐含意义有所不同。
planning,There were relatively few cases reported of attempts to involve users in service planning but their involvement in service provision was found to be more common .,There were relatively few cases reported of attempts to involve users in service planning but their involvement in service provision was found to be most common.,False,False,两个句子中的目标词'planning'含义相同，都指的是服务规划。原句中使用的是'more common'，变异句中使用的是'most common'，这两个短语的区别在于程度的强弱，而不是改变目标词'planning'的含义。因此，尽管表达的程度有所不同，但目标词的含义并未改变。
complementarities,"In the same way as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists , the complementarities existing between locals and immigrants bring it about that the arrival of immigrants has a positive effect on the pay of locals .","In the same way as a surgeon would find it most difficult to work in a country with the worst shortage of anaesthetists, the complementarities existing between locals and immigrants bring it about that the arrival of immigrants has the most positive effect on the pay of locals.",False,False,原句中的'complementarities'表达的是当地居民和移民之间的互补性，这种互补性使得移民的到来对当地居民的薪酬有积极影响。而在变异句中，通过使用'worst shortage'和'the most positive effect'这样的强调词汇，使得'complementarities'的含义被强化，暗示了当地居民和移民之间的互补性不仅存在，而且是极端的、非常显著的。因此，尽管两个句子中的目标词都是'complementarities'，但变异句中的语境使得其含义的强度和范围有所不同。
cold,"Eyes that were clear , but also bright with a strange intensity , a sort of cold fire burning behind them .","Eyes that were clear, but also brightest with a strange intensity, a sort of coldest fire burning behind them.",False,True,原句中的'cold'用作形容词，描述'fire'的性质，指的是情感或激情的冷静、冷酷，表达了一种内在的、不易察觉的强烈情感。而变异句中的'coldest'是形容词的最高级，用来强调火的强度，这里的'cold'更多指的是温度上的冷，与原句中的含义有所不同。
forms,"Colon , lung and breast cancers are the most common and lethal forms of the disease , collectively killing almost 200,000 Americans a year .","Colon, lung and breast cancers are more common and more lethal forms of the disease, collectively killing almost 200,000 Americans a year.",False,False,原句中使用「the most common and lethal forms」强调了这些癌症是最常见和最致命的类型，而变异句中使用的「more common and more lethal forms」虽然也表示这些癌症较为常见和致命，但没有使用「the most」这样的限定词，强度和绝对性上有所不同，因此含义存在细微差别。
larger,"Locally elected school boards , especially in our larger cities , become the prey of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians .","Locally elected school boards, especially in our largest cities, become the prey of most ambitious, generally most corrupt, and invariably most demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians.",False,True,原句中的 'larger' 是比较级，用来表示程度上的相对大小，指的是相对于其他城市来说较大的城市。而变异句中的 'largest' 是最高级，用来表示在一定范围内最大的城市。因此，尽管两词都描述了城市的规模，但 'larger' 和 'largest' 在含义上存在明显差异，'largest' 表达的规模程度更高，更绝对。
training,"Unskilled immigrants work in sectors , which do not attract local labor and the most highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training does is not linked to offers of employment .","Unskilled immigrants work in sectors, which do not attract local labor and the more highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to better offers of employment.",False,False,原句中的'training'指的是培训的一般概念，没有明确指向培训的目的或效果；而变异句中的'training'通过后文'better offers of employment'限定了其含义，指的是能够带来更好工作机会的培训，因此两个句子的目标词在上下文中的含义有所不同。
surfaced,"This being Britain , no woman has filed an equal-opportunity suit , but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to `` The Ringing World , `` a weekly newspaper for ringers .","This being Britain, no woman has filed an equal-opportunity suit, but a bigger extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to ""The Ringing World,"" a weekly newspaper for ringers.",False,False,原句中的'surfaced'指的是问题本质或程度的显露，而变异句中的'surfaced'则强调了问题程度进一步增大的显露。变异句中加入了'bigger'这个形容词来修饰'extent of the problem'，使得surfaced的含义有了变化，指向了问题范围的扩大。
deal,The talks took on new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government arrive to strike a deal .,The talks took on new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve the most outstanding issues before the heads of government arrive to strike a deal.,False,need check,need check
reporting,"One of the most provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial - including mainstream reporters ' extensive use of Twitter - created a `` circus atmosphere '' and such widespread , instant saturation with inflammatory details that the jury was improperly swayed by public passions .","One of the more provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial - including mainstream reporters' extensive use of Twitter - created a ""circus atmosphere"" and such widespread, instant saturation with more inflammatory details that the jury was improperly swayed by public passions.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'reporting'的含义并没有改变。在原句和变异句中，'reporting'都指的是对审判的密集报道。变异句中添加的“more”并不影响'reporting'这个词本身的含义，它只是用来修饰后面的“inflammatory details”，表示报道中包含的更多是具有煽动性的细节，而不是改变'reporting'这个词的意思。
phosphorus,"The microbe does grow better on phosphorus , but showing that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic could occur naturally , either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common .","The microbe does grow best on phosphorus, but showing that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic could occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is most common.",False,False,原句中使用的是‘better’，意味着微生物在磷上的生长只是相对较好，并没有说是最佳；而变异句中使用的是‘best’，表明微生物在磷上的生长是最佳状态，这改变了原句中关于生长条件的相对比较含义。
surprisingly,"Far above in the belfry , the huge bronze bells , mounted on wheels , swing madly through a full 360 degrees , starting and ending , surprisingly , in the inverted , or mouth-up position .","Far above in the belfry, the biggest bronze bells, mounted on wheels, swing madly through a full 360 degrees, starting and ending, surprisingly, in the most inverted, or mouth-up position.",False,False,原句中的'surprisingly'用来强调钟摆开始和结束的位置是出乎意料的，即倒置或口向上的位置。而变异句中的'surprisingly'后面紧跟了程度副词'most'，这使得强调的不仅是位置出乎意料，而且强调的是这种倒置是'最'倒置，即程度上的加深，因此两个句子中'surprisingly'的具体含义有所不同。
provision,There were relatively few cases reported of attempts to involve users in service planning but their involvement in service provision was found to be more common .,There were relatively few cases reported of attempts to involve users in service planning but their involvement in service provision was found to be most common.,False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词'provision'含义相同。在这两个句子中，'service provision'都指的是提供服务的过程或行为，没有因为句子结构的微小变化（'more common'和'most common'）而改变其基本含义。两个形容词都用来描述用户参与服务提供的普遍程度，只是程度上的微小差异，不影响目标词的含义。
