discovered,Your comments implied we had discovered that the `` principal cause `` of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population .,Your thoughtful comments implied that we had eventually discovered that the primary cause of homelessness can actually be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing individuals within the homeless population.,False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'discovered'的含义没有发生变化。'Discovered'在原句和变异句中都表示对某一事实或原因的认识或找到，没有体现出意义上的差异。原句和变异句中的其他词汇变化（如添加了“eventually”和将“principal”替换为“primary”）并不影响'discovered'这个词本身的含义。
frightened,Never in my life have I been so frightened .,Never in my entire life have I been so utterly frightened.,False,False,两个句子中的目标词 'frightened' 在这里都表示感到害怕或惊吓的意思，没有含义上的区别。'Never in my life' 和 'Never in my entire life' 都用于强调，而 'so' 和 'so utterly' 都用于增强 'frightened' 的程度，但并没有改变 'frightened' 本身的含义。
feelings,"Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue , since he is both a vicar and an active bell-ringer himself .","Vicar Marshall openly admits to having mixed feelings regarding this particular issue, since he is both a devoted vicar and a highly active bell-ringer himself.",False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词 'feelings' 在两个句子中的含义相同，都指的是Vicar Marshall对于某个问题的复杂情感或矛盾感受。两个句子都使用了'mixed feelings'这个词组，表明他作为牧师和活跃的钟铃敲击者的双重身份，对于这个问题有着不一致的情感反应。变异句只是增加了细节描述，如'openly admits'和'highly active'，但这并不改变'feelings'这个词本身的含义。

relations,"The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers , a sort of parliament of ringing groups , aims to improve relations with vicars , says John C. Baldwin , president .","The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, a sort of informal parliament of various ringing groups, aims to significantly improve relations with vicars, says John C. Baldwin, the current president.",False,False,两个句子中的目标词'relations'在上下文中都指的是教会钟铃敲击者团体与牧师之间的关系，没有因为句子结构或词汇的变化而产生不同的含义。原句和变异句都表达了改善这种关系的意图，变异句只是增加了程度副词'significantly'来强调改善关系的程度，并且添加了'informal'和'current'来修饰'parliament'和'president'，但这并不改变'relations'这个词的含义。
rare,His was one of two research teams in 1984 to report dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called Wilm 's tumor .,"His was one of two pioneering research teams in 1984 that reported dual chromosome losses in a rare form of childhood cancer affecting the kidney, which is known as Wilm's tumor.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'rare'的含义没有改变。'rare'在两个句子中都是用来形容某种情况或病症不常见或罕见的。原句中描述的是一种罕见的儿童肾癌（Wilm's tumor），变异句中也同样描述的是这种癌症是一种罕见的形式。因此，目标词的含义在两个句子中是一致的。
Calif.,"But the researchers found that the bacteria , discovered in Mono Lake , Calif. , is able to continue to grow after substituting arsenic for phosphorus .","But the researchers astonishingly found that the bacteria, uniquely discovered in Mono Lake, Calif., is actually able to continue growing after substituting arsenic for phosphorus.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'Calif.'的含义是相同的，都指代美国加利福尼亚州。原句和变异句中'Calif.'的位置和上下文没有改变其指代意义，都是在描述发现这种细菌的地理位置。
striking,"Then , at a signal , the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking .","Then, at a given signal, the experienced ringers carefully begin to vary the sequence in which the bells chime, yet they skillfully maintain the unaltered steady rhythm of the striking.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'striking'的含义是相同的。'Striking'在这里指的是钟声的敲击，即钟的敲响动作或者声音。原句和变异句都描述了铃声的顺序在改变，但敲击的稳定节奏保持不变。两个句子中的'striking'都用来描述这种节奏，没有显示出含义上的差异。
question,"The teeth in question , intended to serve to dissuade immigrants , had precisely the opposite effect .","The teeth in question, which were intended to serve as a deterrent to immigrants, had precisely the opposite effect.",False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词 'question' 在这里都是用作形容词短语 'in question'，意为 '被讨论的，被考虑的'。两个句子中的 'in question' 都是指代前文提到的牙齿，表达的是同样的含义，没有发生变化。因此，两个句子中目标词的含义相同。
building,"I was just sitting down to meet with some new therapy clients , a couple , and the building started shaking like crazy .","I was just calmly sitting down to meet with some new therapy clients, a couple, when suddenly the building started shaking like crazy.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词 'building' 的含义并没有改变，都指的是发生摇晃的建筑物。原句中的 'just sitting down' 和变异句中的 'calmly sitting down' 都是在描述动作发生时的状态，并不影响 'building' 的含义。因此，两个句子中的目标词含义相同。
believe,"Any question as to why an author would believe this plaintive , high-minded note of assurance is necessary is answered by reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers .","Any question as to why an author would genuinely believe this plaintive, high-minded note of assurance is necessary is fully answered by carefully reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers.",False,False,"原句和变异句中的目标词 'believe' 在句子中的含义没有明显区别。'believe' 在两个句子中均表示作者对于 'plaintive, high-minded note of assurance' 所持的信任或认同态度。变异句中加入了 'genuinely' 和 'carefully' 两个副词，但这并不改变 'believe' 的基本含义，而是强调了作者相信的程度和阅读的方式。"
rolling,"We finally rendezvoused with our balloon , which had come to rest on a dirt road amid a clutch of Epinalers who watched us disassemble our craft -- another half-an-hour of non-flight activity -- that included the precision routine of yanking the balloon to the ground , punching all the air out of it , rolling it up and cramming it and the basket into the trailer .","We finally rendezvoused with our balloon, which had gently come to rest on a dirt road, amidst a group of curious Epinalers who intently watched us disassemble our craft -- an additional half-an-hour of non-flight activity -- which included the meticulous routine of yanking the balloon to the ground, methodically punching all the air out of it, carefully rolling it up, and skillfully cramming it and the basket into the trailer.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'rolling'的含义没有明显的不同。在原句和变异句中，'rolling'都是指将气球卷起来的动作，没有改变其基本意义。虽然变异句中加入了'carefully'一词，但这并不改变'rolling'这一动作本身的含义，只是描述了动作的执行方式。
slip,"Haney watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently , and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure .","Haney carefully watched the small yet wiry man stealthily slip out the door, and felt greatly relieved to observe that nobody else appeared to notice his quiet departure.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'slip'的含义是相同的。'slip'在这里都指的是某人轻巧、秘密或不引人注意地离开。原句和变异句中的语境都表达了这个人迅速且安静地离开了房间，而且都没有被人注意到。因此，尽管变异句中添加了一些如'carefully'、'stealthily'和'quiet'的副词来进一步描述动作的方式，但这并不改变'slip'这个词的基本含义。
more,"The new money flows into the already top-heavy administrative structure , which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the teachers .","The new money increasingly flows into the already top-heavy administrative structure, which constantly busies itself piling even more paper work on the teachers.",False,True,原句中的'more'用作形容词，表示程度，意为'更多的'，而变异句中的'more'用作副词，修饰动词'flows'和'busies'，表示动作的程度在不断增加，意为'越来越多地'。因此，两个句子中的'more'在语法功能和意义上有所不同。
support,"Of the approximately 200 sponsors of the recent march in Washington for the homeless , you chose to cite such groups as the National Association of Home Builders and the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen , insinuating that the march got its major support from self-serving groups that `` know a good thing when they see it , `` and that the crusade was based on greed or the profit motive .","Of the roughly 200 sponsors of the recent march in Washington advocating for the homeless, you specifically chose to cite influential groups like the National Association of Home Builders and the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, subtly insinuating that the march primarily received its support from self-interested factions who undoubtedly 'know a good thing when they see it,' suggesting that the entire crusade was supposedly based on greed or a profit-driven motive.",False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词'support'在上下文中都指的是游行活动得到的支持，没有体现出含义上的不同。两个句子都表达了相同的观点，即暗示游行的主要支持来自于有私心的团体，这些团体支持游行的动机是出于贪婪或利润驱动。
distressed,"It runs out frantically now and then , and is clearly pretty distressed .","It runs out frantically now and then, rather clearly showing signs of being pretty distressed.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'distressed'的含义没有发生变化。'distressed'用来描述主语'It'的状态，在原句中直接表明'It'感到不安或痛苦，而在变异句中则是通过展示出明显的焦虑迹象来体现这一状态，但本质上都是在表达'It'的不安情绪。
more,It is silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more .,It is a truly silly libel on our teachers to think that they could educate our children more effectively if only they got a few thousand dollars a year extra.,True,True,原句中的'more'用作副词，表示比较级，意为'更好'，强调教育质量的提升；而变异句中的'more effectively'中的'more'用作形容词，修饰副词'effectively'，意为'更有效地'，强调教育方式的效率。因此，两个句子中的'more'所表达的含义和侧重点不同。
