market,"The trend was supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators , which `` have contributed to improving market opinion in relation to the robustness of the economic recovery '' , summarised Charles Schwab 's analysts .","The upward trend was firmly supported by the recent publication of better than expected economic indicators, which have significantly contributed to enhancing market opinion regarding the robustness of the ongoing economic recovery,'' summarised Charles Schwab's seasoned analysts.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'market'的含义没有发生变化。在原句和变异句中，'market opinion'均指的是市场对于经济复苏强劲性的看法或评估，没有体现出不同的上下文意义。
notion,The notion that tracking is somehow `` undemocratic `` is absurd .,The absurd notion that tracking is somehow inherently `` undemocratic '' is truly laughable.,False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词 'notion' 的含义没有发生变化。'Notion' 在两个句子中都是指一种观念、想法或看法，并且都和对于跟踪（tracking）是否具有'反民主'性质的判断有关。原句中，'notion' 被描述为 'absurd'（荒谬的），变异句中，'notion' 被进一步强调为 'absurd notion'（荒谬的观念）并且整个观念被认为是'truly laughable'（确实可笑）。尽管形容词和副词的使用增强了变异句中的语气，但 'notion' 本身的含义没有改变。

dinner,The featured guests at the dinner ? Scalia and Thomas .,The distinguished featured guests at the elegant dinner were Scalia and Thomas.,False,True,原句中的'dinner'仅仅表示一顿饭，而变异句中的'elegant dinner'则强调了晚餐的优雅和精致，暗示了这不仅仅是一顿普通的饭，而可能是一次正式且高档的宴会。因此，尽管两个句子中的目标词都是'dinner'，但变异句通过添加定语'elegant'赋予了它额外的含义和语境。

compared,"In this sense , a teacher can be compared to one 's family doctor .","In this particular sense, a dedicated teacher can be compared to one's trusted family doctor.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词 'compared' 的含义是相同的，都是用作比喻，表示将老师与家庭医生进行比较。变异句虽然增加了 'dedicated' 和 'trusted' 两个形容词来修饰 'teacher' 和 'family doctor'，但这并不改变 'compared' 的基本含义，它仍然是指比较的动作或状态。因此，两个句子中的 'compared' 有着相同的含义。
extent,"To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner 's dilemma game works to their disadvantage , the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates .","To a significant extent, if potential Republican candidates and their financial backers fully realize that the congressional prisoner's dilemma game inherently works to their disadvantage, the Republican Party will consequently be hindered in its subsequent attempts to present a highly competitive slate of congressional candidates.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'extent'的含义是相同的。'To the extent that'和'To a significant extent'都是用来表示程度或者范围的，指的是在一定程度上或者较大程度上。两个短语都用来引出条件或程度，并不改变目标词'extent'的基本意义，即表示程度或范围。因此，两个句子中的'extent'含义没有不同。
needs,"Thus at the recent governors ' conference on education , Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas announced that `` this country needs a comprehensive child-development policy for children under five . ``","Thus, at the recently held governors' conference focusing on education, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas categorically announced that 'this country desperately needs a comprehensive child-development policy for children under five.'",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词 'needs' 的含义没有发生变化。'Needs' 在这里都表达了对全面儿童发展政策的迫切需要，原句没有强调词，而变异句中加入了 'desperately' 来加强语气，但这并不改变 'needs' 本身的基本含义，即仍然指的是需要或要求。
affecting,"However , in both studies , patients whose cancer was not affecting squamous cells had longer survival times if they received Alimta than if they received the comparator .","However, in both aforementioned studies, patients whose cancer was not affecting squamous cells consistently had longer survival times if they received Alimta, as opposed to if they received the comparator drug.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'affecting'的含义没有改变。'affecting'在两个句子中都是现在分词，用来描述癌症对鳞状细胞的作用状态，意味着癌症没有影响到鳞状细胞。两个句子中使用'affecting'的方式和上下文含义是相同的。
appreciation,"The guy sulked over his drink , obviously upset by Haney 's lack of appreciation .","The guy sulkily sulked over his drink, clearly upset by Haney's evident lack of appreciation.",False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词'appreciation'含义相同，都指的是对某人或某事的欣赏、感激或理解。两个句子中的'appreciation'都是指Haney没有表现出对某事的欣赏或感激，因此目标词的含义没有改变。
flopped,"It flopped all around , real dramatic !","It flopped rather dramatically all around, real dramatic!",False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词 'flopped' 都表示某物以一种松散、无力或失败的方式移动或下降，两句话中的副词 'real dramatic' 和 'rather dramatically' 都强调了这一动作的戏剧性或显著程度，但并没有改变 'flopped' 的基本含义。因此，两个句子中目标词的含义相同。
Areas,Areas that are made of ` fill ' liquefy .,Areas that are typically made of 'fill' tend to liquefy.,False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词 'Areas' 的含义是相同的，都是指某些区域。原句中使用 'liquefy' 表示这些区域会液化，而变异句中使用 'tend to liquefy' 表示这些区域倾向于液化。尽管动词的时态和语气有所不同，但目标词 'Areas' 的含义并未改变。
popular,"An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state -LRB- a progressive tax rate hits higher - income states harder -RRB- .","An intriguing additional piece of evidence from the Senate suggests that, while holding other factors constant, such as the established incumbency advantages and significant regional differences, the discrepancy in popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states actively conducting a Senate election is actually a positive function of the degree to which the federal government's tax burden is onerous -LRB- with a progressive tax rate disproportionately affecting higher-income states -RRB-.",False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词'popular'在这里都指的是'民众的，大众的'，用来形容选举中的'选票'（popular votes），表示的是普通民众的投票。两个句子中'popular'的含义并没有改变，都是指代普通民众的投票，因此含义相同。
