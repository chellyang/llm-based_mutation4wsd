mean,So you thought I did n't mean what I said .,So you actually thought I did n't really mean what I said.,False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'mean'的含义是相同的。'mean'在这里指的是说话者表达的真实意图或信念。原句和变异句都使用了否定形式'didn't mean'，并且变异句中添加了'really'来加强语气，但这并不改变'mean'这个词的基本含义。因此，两个句子中的'mean'含义没有不同。

got,He wondered how he got tied up with this stranger .,He idly wondered how he had got tied up with this complete stranger.,False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'got'的含义相同，都表示过去发生的事情，即他与这个陌生人产生联系的方式。原句和变异句中的'got'都是指过去式的不及物动词短语'get tied up'，意为'与...纠缠不清'或'与...产生联系'。变异句中添加的副词'idly'只表示他好奇心的程度，并不改变'got'本身的含义。

case,"Her critics have pushed for Kagan to recuse herself from hearing the case , saying that she was too invested in defending the law then to be impartial now .","Her persistent critics have pushed for Kagan to recuse herself from hearing the crucial case, arguing that she was too deeply invested in defending the law at that time to be truly impartial now.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'case'的含义没有发生变化。'case'在原句和变异句中都指的是需要被审理的具体诉讼案件。两个句子中的其他词汇变化（如原句中的'saying'变为变异句中的'arguing'，以及添加了'persistent'和'crucial'作为修饰词）并不影响目标词'case'的含义。

absurd,The notion that tracking is somehow `` undemocratic `` is absurd .,The absurd notion that tracking is somehow inherently `` undemocratic '' is truly laughable.,False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'absurd'的含义没有发生变化。'absurd'用来形容一个观点或想法是荒谬的、不合理的。在原句中，'is absurd'直接说明了这个观点是荒谬的；在变异句中，'the absurd notion'也指这个想法是荒谬的。两个句子中的'absurd'都用来表达同样的意思，即对'tracking is somehow undemocratic'这一观点的否定。
today,The others here today live elsewhere .,The others who are here today actually live elsewhere.,False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词'today'含义相同，都指的是说话时的当天。两个句子中的'today'没有因为加入'actually'或其他语境因素而改变其基本含义。
