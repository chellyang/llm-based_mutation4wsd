felt,I have felt many aftershocks .,I have felt several aftershocks.,False,False,在这个情境下，'felt' 在原句和变异句中的含义是一致的。'Felt' 在这里指的是感觉或体验到，无论是 'many' 还是 'several' 都是在描述感觉到的地震余震的数量，而不影响 'felt' 的基本含义。
building,This building shook like hell and it kept getting stronger .,This building shook like hell and it kept getting much stronger.,False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词 'building' 的含义并没有发生变化。'shook like hell' 和 'kept getting stronger' 或 'kept getting much stronger' 都在描述这栋建筑物震动的情况，而 'stronger' 和 'much stronger' 都表示程度的增加，但并不改变 'building' 作为名词所指的实体，即建筑物的本身含义。因此，两个句子中的 'building' 有着相同的含义。
report,"However , the announcement of a news conference to discuss it , which did not disclose details of the find , generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report would disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life .","However, the announcement of a news conference to discuss it, which did not disclose any specifics of the find, generated considerable speculation on the Internet that the report would reveal the discovery of extraterrestrial life.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'report'的含义是一致的。'report'在这两个句子中都是指一个关于发现的正式声明或公布，无论是原句中的'generate widespread speculation'还是变异句中的'generate considerable speculation'都表明了人们对这个'report'将要揭露的内容充满期待，即外星生命的发现。因此，两个句子中的'report'含义相同，没有差异。
reminder,"Tuesday 's rout of a GOP congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district that has n't backed a Democratic presidential candidate since Adlai Stevenson is another reminder that , at least at the federal level , political `` ticket splitting `` has been on the rise over the past half century .","Tuesday's rout of a GOP congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district that hasn't backed a Democratic presidential candidate since Adlai Stevenson is another reminder that, at least at the federal level, political 'ticket splitting' has been on the rise over the past few decades.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'reminder'的含义没有变化。'reminder'在原句和变异句中都是指引起注意或记忆的某事物，表明Mississippi district的选举结果提醒人们联邦层面的政治“跨党投票”在过去几十年里有所上升。尽管变异句中使用了'past few decades'而原句中使用'past half century'，但这并不影响'reminder'这个词的含义。
plays,"Ivanovic 's players , injured but far from dead , needed to run a couple of plays correctly before they could breathe , and that 's when the machine gun Marza Teletovic arrived , with three almost consecutive three-pointers and the help of English and Ribas , he brought the scoreboard back to a reassuring lead ( 54-67 ) , which the home team managed to narrow down at the end of the third quarter ( 57-67 ) .","Ivanovic 's players, injured but far from dead, needed to run a few plays correctly before they could breathe, and that's when the machine gun Marza Teletovic arrived, with several almost consecutive three-pointers and the help of English and Ribas, he brought the scoreboard back to a reassuring lead ( 54-67 ), which the home team managed to narrow down at the end of the third quarter ( 57-67 ).",False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词 'plays' 在这里都指的是篮球战术或特定的移动配合，用于比赛中正确的执行。'run a couple of plays' 和 'run a few plays' 在这个上下文中含义相同，都表达了需要执行一些战术配合的意思，没有体现出含义上的差异。
head,"The stranger , his head seemingly sunk in thought , started to cross the street against the light just as a huge moving van roared through the intersection .","The stranger, his head seemingly sunk in a couple of thoughts, started to cross the street against the light just as a large moving van roared through the intersection.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'head'的含义没有变化，都是指人的头部。原句和变异句中的差异在于修饰'head'的状语，原句中使用'in thought'，变异句中使用'in a couple of thoughts'，但这并不改变'head'本身的含义。因此，两个句子中的目标词含义相同。
progress,"When it was n't my turn in the balloon I followed its progress from the `` chase car , `` listening to the driver holler into a walkie-talkie .","When it wasn't my turn in the balloon I followed its progress from the `` chase car, '' listening to the driver holler into a couple of walkie-talkies.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词 'progress' 的含义是相同的。'Progress' 在这里指的是热气球飞行过程中的进展或动态。原句中使用单数形式的 'a walkie-talkie' 而变异句中使用复数形式的 'a couple of walkie-talkies'，这并不影响 'progress' 的含义，因为这里讨论的是热气球的进展，而不是通讯设备。因此，尽管通讯设备的数量发生了变化，但 'progress' 的含义保持一致。
teaching,"I know many schoolteachers and , on the whole , they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching .","I know a number of schoolteachers and, on the whole, they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching.",False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词'teaching'在句子中的含义没有区别。两个句子中'teaching'都是指教师们认真负责地进行的教学活动，整个语境和上下文没有改变，因此目标词的含义相同。

longer,"But if the genes are damaged -- perhaps by radiation , a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division -- their growth-suppressing proteins no longer work , and cells normally under control turn malignant .","But if the genes are damaged -- perhaps by radiation, a chemical, or due to a random accident during cell division -- their growth-suppressing proteins no longer function properly, and cells that are typically under control become malignant.",False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词 'longer' 在句子中的含义没有区别，都表示 '不再' 的意思。在两个句子中，'no longer' 都用来表明基因受损后，生长抑制蛋白失去了原有的功能。
repression,"The whole notion of `` creativity `` in education was ( and is ) part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction , which was ( and is ) regarded as `` authoritarian , `` a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful , if as yet undefined , potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children .","The whole notion of `` creativity `` in education was ( and is ) part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction , which was ( and is ) regarded as `` authoritarian , `` a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful , if as yet undefined , potentialities inherent in the souls of every single one of our children .",False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词'repression'在各自的语境中含义相同，都指的是对内在潜力和才能的压制和抑制。两个句子中'repression'的使用并没有因为句子结构或词汇的变化而产生不同的含义。在这两个句子中，'repression'都是指教育中对孩子们潜在才能的限制和挫败，这种含义在两个句子中是一致的。
say,"In a report out last week , John Minna and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute say that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene .","In a report released last week, John Minna and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute say that approximately a majority of the cells extracted from lung cancer tissue they examined are lacking this gene.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'say'的含义没有发生变化。'Say'在两个句子中都是指表达观点、发现或结论。原句和变异句中的差异在于描述研究结果的细节（如“about half”变为“approximately a majority”），但这并不影响'say'本身的含义。
low,"In a low voice , almost whispering , the man had asked Phil if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken off his back .","In a low voice, almost whispering, the man had asked Phil if he was content with the manner in which the landlord had been removed from his back.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'low'都用来形容声音的大小，意指低声或轻声。原句和变异句中的'low voice'含义相同，都是指说话声音低沉，几乎是在耳语。因此，两个句子中目标词的含义没有不同。

reported,"Then last spring , researchers reported finding a gene called p53 which , if impaired , turns healthy colon cells cancerous .","Then last spring, researchers reported finding a single gene called p53 which, if damaged, can convert a number of healthy colon cells cancerous.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'reported'的含义没有发生变化。'reported'在两个句子中都是指研究人员进行了公布或报告的动作，不论是原句中的'finding a gene called p53'还是变异句中的'finding a single gene called p53'，都是研究人员发现并公布的内容。因此，目标词的含义没有差异。
proposed,"The story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the 1970s , when a pediatrician named Alfred G. Knudson Jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects .","The story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the 1970s, when a pediatrician named Alfred G. Knudson Jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from a couple of separate genetic defects.",False,False,在这个例子中，原句和变异句中的目标词 'proposed' 的含义是相同的。'Proposed' 在两个句子中都是过去式动词，表示提出理论或观点。原句中使用 'two separate genetic defects' 而变异句中使用 'a couple of separate genetic defects'，这两个短语都表达了数量的概念，'two' 和 'a couple of' 都意味着两个，尽管表达方式略有不同，但这并不影响 'proposed' 的含义。因此，两个句子中的 'proposed' 含义没有差异。
probing,"Dr. Vogelstein and a doctoral student , Eric Fearon , began months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage .","Dr. Vogelstein and a doctoral student, Eric Fearon, began several months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage.",False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词 'probing' 在两个句子中的含义没有区别。两个句子都描述了Vogelstein博士和Eric Fearon在进行染色体研究的过程，寻找遗传损伤的迹象。'Probing' 在这里指的是仔细的探索和研究，这个含义在两个句子中保持一致，没有变化。
