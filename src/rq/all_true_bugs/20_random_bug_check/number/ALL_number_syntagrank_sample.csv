changes,"Because the poll has been taken regularly since 1995 , it tracks changes in attitude across the region .","Because the poll has been taken on a consistent basis since the mid-1990s, it monitors several changes in attitude throughout the region.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词 'changes' 都指的是在一段时间内对态度变化的追踪或监测。原句和变异句中的 'changes' 含义相同，都是指代态度的变化，并且没有指出变异句中的 'several changes' 意味着与原句中的 'changes' 有不同的含义。因此，两个句子中的目标词含义没有差异。
posturing,"The U.N.-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by unruly posturing and mutual recriminations -- gained renewed focus Friday with the release of a document outlining ambitious greenhouse-gas reductions over the next 40 years , with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden in the near term .","The U.N.-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by unruly posturing and mutual recriminations -- gained renewed focus Friday with the release of a document outlining ambitious greenhouse-gas reductions over the following four decades, with industrialized nations shouldering a majority of the burden in the near term.",False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词'posturing'在各自的上下文中含义相同，都指的是与会者在气候会议上的不合规矩的做作姿态或者虚张声势的行为。两个句子中的'posturing'都用来描述会议初期无序的状态，没有体现出含义上的差异。
Democratic,"To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies , voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office .","To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a significant share of power in Congress since the early 20th century and have been able to translate such influence into numerous local benefits for their respective constituencies, voters in the South have had a particularly strong incentive to maintain such Democrats in office.",False,True,在原句中，'Democratic'一词指的是特定的政治党派成员，即美国的民主党成员，并且强调了自1932年以来这些南方民主党立法者在国会中占据了不成比例的权力份额。而在变异句中，'Democratic'一词虽然同样指代民主党成员，但其语境扩展到了整个20世纪早期，并且指的是他们持有显著的权力份额，而非不成比例的权力。这种语境上的扩展和时间范围的改变表明，在两个句子中，'Democratic'一词的含义可以有所不同，原句更强调权力集中的特殊性，而变异句则强调其持续的影响力。
reporting,"One of the most provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial - including mainstream reporters ' extensive use of Twitter - created a `` circus atmosphere '' and such widespread , instant saturation with inflammatory details that the jury was improperly swayed by public passions .","One of the most provocative is that the extensive reporting on the trial - including numerous reporters' widespread use of Twitter - created a `` circus atmosphere '' and such comprehensive, immediate saturation with inflammatory details that the jury was improperly influenced by public passions.",False,True,原句中的'reporting'侧重于报道的强度和密集程度，强调的是报道的深入和连续性，而变异句中的'reporting'则侧重于报道的广泛性和数量，强调的是报道的范围和多次提及。'intense'与'extensive'在含义上有所不同，前者指的是强烈的、深入的，后者指的是广泛的、大量的。因此，两个句子中的目标词'reporting'所承载的含义是可以有差异的。
represented,The man with the clipboard represented a halfhearted attempt to introduce a bit of les sportif into our itinerary .,The man with the clipboard represented a partial attempt to introduce a bit of les sportif into our itinerary.,False,True,原句中的'represented'含义更偏向于表现出或象征某种程度的不完整或不充分的尝试，而变异句中的'represented'则更侧重于表示某种部分的、不完全的尝试。虽然两个词都可以解释为表示某种尝试，但前者隐含了情感色彩，即尝试的不热情或不用心，后者则更客观，强调尝试的不完整性。因此，两个句子中的目标词含义存在细微差别。
ruin,So the driver started to curse at both of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin his safe-driving record .,So the driver started to curse at them as if they had been in a scheme together to ruin his safe-driving record.,False,False,在这个情境中，原句和变异句中的目标词 'ruin' 都指的是破坏或毁掉司机的安全驾驶记录。'plot' 和 'scheme' 都表达了合谋或阴谋的意思，但这并不影响目标词 'ruin' 的含义。因此，无论在原句还是变异句中，'ruin' 的含义是相同的。
making,"Each legislator , after all , is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making .","Each legislator, after all, is just one among hundreds when it comes to national policy making.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词 'making' 的含义是一致的。'making' 在这里都是指制定政策的过程，即 'policy making'。原句中的 '535' 和变异句中的 'hundreds' 都是在描述立法者在全国政策制定中的相对数量，但这并不影响 'making' 的含义。因此，尽管数量表述不同，'making' 的含义并未改变。

same,"Mr. Quinlan , 30 years old , knew he carried a damaged gene , having lost an eye to the rare tumor when he was only two months old -- after his mother had suffered the same fate when she was a baby .","Mr. Quinlan, in his thirties, knew he carried a damaged gene, having lost an eye to the rare tumor when he was just a couple of months old -- after his mother had suffered the same fate when she was an infant.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'same'的含义是一致的。'Same'在这里指的是Mr. Quinlan和他母亲遭受了相同的命运，即都因罕见的肿瘤而失去了视力。两个句子中并没有改变这一含义，因此目标词的具体含义没有不同。
turned,"Dr. Vogelstein next turned his attention colon cancer , the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer .","Dr. Vogelstein next turned his attention to colon cancer, one of the major cancer killers in the U.S. after lung cancer.",False,False,在这两个句子中，'turned'的含义没有变化。'Turned'在这里都是指Dr. Vogelstein将他的注意力或研究方向转向了结肠癌。无论是原句中的'turned his attention colon cancer'还是变异句中的'turned his attention to colon cancer'，'turned'都表达了同样的动作，即转移或调整焦点。

ruling,"The trial judge , Jon C. Blue of State Superior Court , tersely rejected the claims in a ruling last week , saying that the news media were `` carefully controlled '' and that there was no evidence the jury was driven by passion .","The trial judge, Jon C. Blue of State Superior Court, tersely rejected the claims in a ruling the previous week, saying that the news media were `` carefully controlled '' and that there was no evidence the jury was driven by passion.",False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词 'ruling' 在两个句子中的含义没有区别，都指的是法官在审判过程中作出的决定或裁决。两句话的区别仅在于时间状语的使用（'last week' 和 'the previous week'），但这并不影响目标词的含义。
same,"There are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation , some of them in the poorest of ghettos , and they are all sending us the same message .","There are numerous successful schools scattered throughout this nation, several of them in the poorest of ghettos, and they are all sending us the same message.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'same'的含义没有变化。'Same'在这两个句子中都是形容词，用来指代前面提到的'message'，表示信息是一致的、相同的。无论是原句还是变异句，'same'都用来强调不论这些成功学校位于何处，他们传达的信息是统一的。因此，目标词的含义没有体现出不同。
shelter,"Homeless people not only lack safety , privacy and shelter , they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition , cleanliness and basic health care .","Homeless people not only lack safety, privacy, and a place to shelter, they also lack the basic necessities of nutrition, cleanliness, and essential health care.",True,True,在原句中，'shelter'作为一个名词，指的是一个遮蔽处，避难所，通常抽象地代表一个住所或保护的地方。而在变异句中，'shelter'被用作动词，短语'a place to shelter'指的是一个可以躲避风雨、获得保护的具体地点。因此，尽管两个句子中的目标词都是'shelter'，但它们的用法和含义在这个上下文中是有区别的。
support,"A more robust economic performance is reflected in rising support for private enterprise and the market economy : some 71 % of respondents across the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development , up from 56 % in 2007 ( see chart 6 ) .","A more robust economic performance is reflected in rising support for private enterprise and the market economy: approximately three-quarters of respondents across the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, up from over half in 2007 (see chart 6).",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'support'的含义是一致的。两个句子都描述了对于私营企业和市场经济的支持度上升的情况。在原句中，'support'指的是调查对象对于私营企业的重要性所持的观点或态度，而在变异句中，尽管使用了“approximately three-quarters”来描述这一支持的比例，但'support'的实质含义并没有改变，仍然是关于人们对于私营企业必要性的认可。因此，两个句子中的'support'含义相同，结果为False。
teaching,"I know many schoolteachers and , on the whole , they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching .","I know a number of schoolteachers and, on the whole, they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching.",False,False,原句和变异句中的目标词'teaching'在句子中的含义没有区别。两个句子中'teaching'都是指教师们认真负责地进行的教学活动，整个语境和上下文没有改变，因此目标词的含义相同。
months,"In patients who had received chemotherapy in the past , the average survival time was 8.3 months with Alimta , compared with 7.9 months with docetaxel .","In patients who had received chemotherapy in the past, the average survival time was nearly nine months with Alimta, compared with about eight months with docetaxel.",False,False,在这两个句子中，'months'的含义是一致的，都是指患者在接受治疗后平均生存时间的单位。原句中提到具体的时间为8.3个月和7.9个月，而变异句中将这些数字近似为九个月和八个月，但不论是具体数值还是近似数值，'months'代表的都是相同的时间单位，没有改变其基本含义。
more,"Change-ringing , a mind-boggling exercise the English invented 380 years ago , requires physical dexterity -- some bells weigh more than a ton -- combined with intense mental concentration .","Change-ringing, a mind-boggling exercise the English invented over three centuries ago, requires physical dexterity -- a few bells weigh more than a metric ton -- combined with intense mental concentration.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'more'的含义是一致的。'More than a ton'和'a few bells weigh more than a metric ton'都表示重量超过了某一特定的度量单位（吨），这里的'more'用来表示程度的增加，没有在两个句子中表现出不同的含义。
Right,"In 2005 , the fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was felt both on the Left and on the Right .","In 2005, the fear of invasion of the national territory by numerous Polish plumbers was felt both on the Left and on the Right.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词 'Right' 都指的是政治上的右派，即政治光谱中的一个特定群体。原句和变异句的语境没有改变这个词汇的含义，都是在谈论政治立场。因此，无论是原句还是变异句中，'Right' 的含义是相同的，不表现出不同含义。
figure,"Some 31 % say that either they or a close relative have been victims of crime over the past year , but that is down from 38 % last year and is the lowest figure since 1995 .","Some three out of ten say that either they or a close relative have been victims of crime over the past year, but that is down from four out of ten last year and is the lowest figure since 1995.",False,False,在这两个句子中，目标词'figure'的含义是一致的。'Figure'在这里指的是一个具体的数字或百分比，用来描述犯罪受害者的比例。原句中的'31%'和变异句中的'three out of ten'都表达了同样的比例概念，而随后的比较和提及'lowest figure since 1995'也表明了'figure'指的是一个随时间变化的数据点。因此，两个句子中的'figure'含义没有不同。
